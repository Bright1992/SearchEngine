[00:43.49]Oceans apart day after day
[00:50.19]And I slowly go insane
[00:54.91]I hear your voice on the line
[01:00.94]But it doesn't stop the pain
[01:05.61]If I see you next to never
[01:10.75]How can we say forever
[01:14.97]
[01:15.79]Wherever you go
[01:18.72]Whatever you do
[01:21.03]I will be right here waiting for you
[01:26.65]Whatever it takes
[01:29.27]Or how my heart breaks
[01:31.55]I will be right here waiting for you
[01:37.97]
[01:43.10]I took for granted, all the times
[01:49.19]That I thought would last somehow
[01:53.67]I hear that laughter, I taste the tears
[01:59.62]But I can't get near you now
[02:03.97]
[02:04.55]Oh, can't you see it baby
[02:09.53]You've got me goin crazy
[02:13.88]
[02:14.70]Wherever you go
[02:17.33]Whatever you do
[02:19.61]I will be right here waiting for you
[02:25.37]Whatever it takes
[02:27.88]Or how my heart breaks
[02:30.27]I will be right here waiting for you
[02:36.48]
[02:37.08]I wonder how we can survive
[02:42.05]This romance
[02:47.59]But in the end if I'm with you
[02:51.70]I'll take the chance
[03:05.90]Waiting for you
[03:09.01]
[03:18.93]Oh, can't you see it baby
[03:24.06]You've got me goin crazy
[03:28.97]
[03:29.51]Wherever you go
[03:31.95]Whatever you do
[03:34.39]I will be right here waiting for you
[03:40.08]Whatever it takes
[03:42.63]Or how my heart breaks
[03:44.95]I will be right here waiting for you
[03:58.90]Waiting for you
[04:05.77]
