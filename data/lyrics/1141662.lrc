[00:09.100]Every time I see your smile
[00:12.930]It makes my heart beat fast
[00:16.680]And though it's much too soon to tell
[00:21.010]I'm hoping this will last
[00:24.550]
[00:24.810]Cause I just always wanna have you right here
[00:30.700]By my side
[00:33.640]The future's near
[00:35.700]But never certain
[00:38.130]So please stay here for just tonight.
[00:42.060]
[00:42.380]I must have done something right
[00:46.210]To deserve you in my life
[00:50.630]I must have done something right along the way
[00:52.150]
[00:58.590]I just can't get you off my mind
[01:03.150]And why would I even try
[01:07.640]Even when I close my eyes
[01:11.390]I dream about you all the time
[01:15.980]
[01:16.450]I just always wanna have you right here
[01:21.430]By my side
[01:24.480]The futures near
[01:26.450]But never certain
[01:28.500]So please stay here for just tonight
[01:33.040]
[01:33.410]I must've done something right
[01:37.050]To deserve you in my life
[01:41.550]I must've done something right along the way
[01:47.770]
[01:50.170]And even if the moon fell down tonight
[01:58.800]There'd be nothing to worry about at all
[02:01.990]Because you make the whole world shine
[02:06.490]As long as you're here
[02:09.110]Everything will be alright
[02:20.340]
[02:23.570]I must of done something right
[02:27.490]To deserve you in my life
[02:32.170]I must of done something right along the way
