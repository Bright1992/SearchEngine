[00:26.200]There's been a lot of hurting,
[00:29.020]We need a lot of healing,
[00:32.110]If something aingt working,
[00:35.600]Can't fight the feeling.
[00:38.320]There's been a lot of talking,
[00:40.960]We need a little listening,
[00:44.330]A bit of soul searching,
[00:47.340]To get back what's missing.
[00:50.850]You know you gotta spread your wings,
[00:54.050]Open up your heart and see,
[00:56.630]Everywhere, everybody knows
[00:59.700]We need a revolution.
[01:02.950]Said you gotta spread your wings,
[01:05.910]Don't wait for what tomorrow brings,
[01:09.040]You and me, we're gonna be
[01:11.420]Part of the solution.
[01:14.000]It's not about the things you say,
[01:16.550]It's about the things you do,
[01:20.060]It's all about the love you give
[01:23.180]Oh we can change, we can change the world.
[01:27.220]Step by step,
[01:28.730]Gotta build it back brick by brick,
[01:32.010]Oh, with a little time, with a little love,
[01:36.090]We can change, we can change the world.
[01:44.100]We can change the world.
[01:52.390]There's been a lot of violence,
[01:55.020]People keeping quiet,
[01:58.420]It's time to break the silence,
[02:01.310]Kill them with the kindness.
[02:04.500]Seems like we're running out of time,
[02:07.320]No one makes it out alive,
[02:10.250]With a little hope, with a little faith,
[02:13.180]We can change, we can change the world.
[02:17.560]You gotta spread your wings,
[02:19.810]Open up your heart and see,
[02:22.810]Everywhere, everybody knows
[02:26.070]We need a revolution.
[02:29.150]Said you gotta spread your wings,
[02:32.030]Don't wait for what tomorrow brings,
[02:35.110]You and me, we're gonna be
[02:37.430]Part of the solution.
[02:40.250]It's not about the things you say,
[02:43.070]It's about the things you do,
[02:46.200]It's all about the love you give
[02:49.690]Oh we can change, we can change the world.
[02:53.300]Step by step,
[02:55.180]Gotta build it back brick by brick,
[02:58.260]Oh, with a little time, with a little love,
[03:02.450]We can change, we can change the world.
[03:07.230]We can change the world.
[03:10.980]You and I,
[03:14.630]Time waits for no one.
[03:18.390]It's not about the things you say,
[03:21.700]It's about the things you do,
[03:24.470]All about the love you gave
[03:28.060]And you give it to.
[03:30.680]It's not about the things you say,
[03:33.810]It's about the things you do,
[03:36.830]It's all about the love you give

[03:44.110]Step by step,
[03:45.860]Gotta build it back brick by brick,
[03:48.860]Oh, with a time, little with a little love,
[03:53.140]We can change, we can change the world.
[03:57.870]We can change the world.
[04:01.840]You and I,
[04:05.410]We can change, we can change the world.
[04:11.690]Oh, with a little time, with a little love,
[04:17.340]We can change, we can change the world.
