Raindrops, raindrops on your face
So familiar that old place
October nights and cloudy skies
Nothing left but your goodbye
I miss you
Really miss you
Don't want the summer over
Let me feel the heat again
Don't tell me that it's over
I wanna lay in summer rain
A thousand dreams tonight
Wouldn't ever be the same
As you and I making love
In the summer rain
6 am in the twilight
Watching stars fade in the sky
Pouring down but we don't care
Running my hands through your hair
I miss you
Really miss you
Don't want the summer over
Let me feel the heat again
Don't tell me that it's over
I wanna lay in summer rain
A thousand dreams tonight
Wouldn't ever be the same
As you and I making love
In the summer rain
I miss you
Really miss you
Dont want the summer over
Let me feel the heat again
Don't tell me that it's over
I wanna lay in summer rain
A thousand dreams tonight
Wouldn't ever be the same
As you and I making love
In the summer rain
