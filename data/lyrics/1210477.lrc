[00:16.58]Wake up in the middle of the night, I can't sleep
[00:20.55]Baby you're on my mind.
[00:23.09]Glance at the clock and it's only 3:15,
[00:27.53]Another restless night.
[00:31.82]I got my hand on the dial, should I call, should I wait
[00:36.09]Should I stop?
[00:40.37]All I know is that it hurts so deep,
[00:44.52]I can't get you out of my mind.
[00:49.46]May be already too late for us,
[00:53.53]But I can't just walk away.
[00:57.90]Pickin' my knees when you look at me, that way...
[01:08.05]I'm falling in deeper, I'm falling in
[01:16.87]I'm falling in deeper, I'm falling in
[01:25.44]I'm falling in deeper, gotta find a way to keep her
[01:34.52]I'm falling in deeper again
[01:42.16]
[01:44.67]Sit at the edge of my bed, honey
[01:48.64]Damn I could use a drink.
[01:51.51]Hear on the radio, a sad song I know
[01:57.21]It only makes me think
[02:00.36]That here you're walking out that door,
[02:04.45]Down the hall, to the car, couldn't stop.
[02:07.81]All I know is that the pain's so deep,
[02:14.48]I can't get you out of my mind.
[02:19.31]I'm falling in deeper, I'm falling in
[02:28.21]I'm falling in deeper, I'm falling in
[02:36.78]I'm falling in deeper, gotta find a way to keep her
[02:45.48]I'm falling in deeper again
[02:54.33]It's maybe already too late for us,
[02:58.48]But I can't just walk away.
[03:02.87]I'm pickin' my knees when you look at me, that way...
[03:10.56]I'm falling in deeper, I'm falling in
[03:20.40]I'm falling in deeper, I'm falling in
[03:29.42]I'm falling in deeper, gotta find a way to keep her
[03:37.71]I'm falling in deeper again
[03:46.98]I'm falling in deeper, I'm falling in
[03:55.23]I'm falling in deeper, I'm falling in
[04:04.54]I'm falling in deeper, gotta find a way to keep her
[04:12.61]I'm falling in deeper again
[04:23.00]
