[00:00.86]I've been pushing forward, but I don't think I'm gainin' much.
[00:08.66]If I help you up, will you be my crutch?
[00:15.07]And the world can see, my Juliet around my neck
[00:22.52]Not a weight, she's keeping my head up.
[00:29.46]Juliet, heaven can wait
[00:36.35]There'll always be a place for someone like you
[00:43.01]Juliet, heaven can wait
[00:50.47]No, they can't take you away from me.
[00:56.30]And they won't take me away from you.
[01:04.93]Away from you...
[01:11.09]
[01:12.58]All the wine and roses seem so far away,
[01:18.89]From the life we live as I hold you here today
[01:26.01]Yes I loved you up into a sunset paradise,
[01:33.10]That your smile help to awake.
[01:39.71]Juliet, heaven can wait
[01:47.29]There'll always be a place for someone like you
[01:54.26]Juliet, heaven can wait
[02:01.42]No, they can't take you away from me.
[02:08.68]When love's not what it seems,
[02:15.08]When you try but you can't reach your dreams,
[02:21.84]When time's not always on your side
[02:29.66]No they can't take you away
[02:33.26]Can't take you
[02:38.57]Juliet, heaven can wait
[02:45.08]There'll always be a place for someone like you
[02:52.13]Juliet, heaven can wait
[02:59.74]No, they can't take you away from me.
[03:05.22]And they won't take me away from you.
[03:14.87]Away from you...
[03:21.59]
