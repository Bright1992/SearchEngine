[01:15.06]A shot in the dark
[01:17.46]A past, lost in space
[01:22.35]Where do I start
[01:24.86]The past, and the chase
[01:29.71]You want to be gone
[01:32.07]Like a wolf, a predator
[01:37.08]I feel like a deer in the light
[01:44.60]Your love be in that frozen time
[01:52.03]Hungry for that flesh of mine
[01:59.25]But I can't compete with the she wolf, who has brought me to my knees
[02:06.77]What do you see in those yellow eyes
[02:10.93]Cause i'm falling to pieces
[02:14.83]I'm falling to pieces
[02:18.57]I'm falling to pieces
[02:22.08]I'm falling to pieces
[02:26.05]Falling to pieces
[02:58.32]Your love be in that frozen time
[03:05.70]Hungry for that flesh of mine
[03:13.07]But I can't compete with the she wolf, who has brought me to my knees
[03:20.63]What do you see in those yellow eyes
[03:24.80]Cause i'm falling to pieces
[03:28.64]I'm falling to pieces
[03:32.39]I'm falling to pieces
[03:35.83]I'm falling to pieces
[03:39.87]Falling to pieces
