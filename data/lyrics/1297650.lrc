[00:00.590]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[00:04.999]But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
[00:10.967]Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
[00:16.870]But that's alright because I love the way you lie
[00:22.589]I love the way you lie
[00:22.678]I can't tell you what it really is
[00:23.878][Eminem]
[00:26.698]I can only tell you what it feels like
[00:28.889]And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe
[00:31.399]I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
[00:34.390]As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
[00:37.209]High off of love, drunk from my hate,
[00:39.549]It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
[00:42.649]And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
[00:46.190]She fucking hates me and I love it.
[00:48.190]Wait! Where you going?
[00:49.279]"I'm leaving you"
[00:50.299]No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.
[00:53.690]Here we go again
[00:54.290]It's so insane cause when it's going good, it's going great
[00:57.200]I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
[00:57.879]But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped
[01:02.400]Who's that dude? I don't even know his name
[01:05.249]I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
[01:08.189]I guess I don't know my own strength
[01:10.490]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[01:15.729]But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
[01:20.549]Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
[01:26.500]But that's alright because I love the way you lie
[01:30.790]I love the way you lie
[01:36.889]I love the way you lie
[01:38.879][Eminem]
[01:42.939]You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
[01:46.300]When you're with 'em
[01:47.790]You meet and neither one of you even knows what hit 'em
[01:49.090]Got that warm fuzzy feeling
[01:49.978]Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
[01:51.208]Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
[01:53.989]You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
[01:57.200]Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
[02:00.800]You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit 'em
[02:02.290]Throw 'em down pin 'em
[02:03.859]So lost in the moments when you're in them
[02:06.469]It's the rage that took over it controls you both
[02:08.888]So they say you're best to go your separate ways
[02:10.160]Guess if they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
[02:14.380]Yesterday is over, it's a different day
[02:15.589]Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
[02:17.977]Next time you show restraint
[02:20.197]You don't get another chance
[02:20.867]Life is no Nintendo game
[02:22.437]But you lied again
[02:23.447]Now you get to watch her leave out the window
[02:25.379]I guess that's why they call it window pane
[02:25.617]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[02:33.537]But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
[02:37.597]Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
[02:42.618]But that's alright because I love the way you lie
[02:48.079]I love the way you lie
[02:54.378]I love the way you lie
[02:57.697][Eminem]
[03:00.207]Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
[03:03.789]And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
[03:06.287]But your temper's just as bad as mine is
[03:08.888]You're the same as me
[03:09.577]But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
[03:11.697]Baby, please come back
[03:13.367]It wasn't you, baby it was me
[03:14.488]Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
[03:18.289]Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
[03:21.147]All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
[03:23.888]Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
[03:25.816]Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
[03:29.407]I told you this is my fault
[03:30.776]Look me in the eyeball
[03:31.978]Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
[03:34.317]Next time. There won't be no next time
[03:36.348]I apologize even though I know its lies
[03:39.137]I'm tired of the games I just want her back
[03:41.317]I know I'm a liar
[03:43.980]If she ever tries to fucking leave again
[03:44.847]Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
[03:48.777]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[03:51.288]I'm just gonna
[03:53.679]But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
[03:58.797]Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
[04:03.780]But that's alright because I love the way you lie
[04:08.587]I love the way you lie
[04:13.997]I love the way you lie
