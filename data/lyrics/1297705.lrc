[00:00.25]【Intro: sampled】
[00:00.88]Love, love
[00:14.50]Love, love, love
[00:22.11]Don't hurt me
[00:23.66]Don't hurt me no more, no more
[00:26.29]【Verse 1: Lil Wayne】
[00:26.30]Young Money
[00:30.40]Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
[00:33.95]But it's "Fuck the world!", get a child out her
[00:37.70]Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
[00:41.40]Been to Hell and back, I can show you vouchers
[00:45.10]I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
[00:48.72]Married to the game, but she broke her vows
[00:52.65]That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
[00:56.20]And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
[01:00.60]I think about more than I forget
[01:03.30]But I don't go 'round fire expecting not to sweat
[01:07.05]And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
[01:11.05]Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg
[01:14.70]Money outweighin' problems on the triple beam
[01:18.10]I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
[01:23.11]Be good or be good at it
[01:25.80]Fuckin' right, I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
[01:29.50]Yeah, put a dick in their mouth
[01:31.00]So I guess it's "Fuck what they say!"
[01:32.40]I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away
[01:34.27]Man, I come down in a couple of days
[01:36.10]OK, you want me up in the cage
[01:38.10]Then I'll come out in beast mode
[01:39.93]I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
[01:43.55]It's Weezy, motherfucker
[01:45.17]Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
[01:47.55]All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
[01:51.35]So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
[01:55.60]No love lost, no love found
[01:58.99]【Hook: Eminem and Lil Wayne】
[01:59.00]It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
[02:02.55]You kicked me when I was down
[02:04.28]But what you say just (don't hurt me)
[02:06.69]That's right (don't hurt me)
[02:08.10]And I don't need you (no more)
[02:09.88]Don't want to see you (no more)
[02:12.18]Bitch, you get (no love)
[02:13.60]You showed me nothin' but hate, you ran me into the ground
[02:17.20]But what comes around goes around
[02:19.45]I don't need you (don't hurt me)
[02:21.40]That's right (don't hurt me)
[02:22.88]And I don't need you (no more)
[02:24.66]Don't want to see you (no more)
[02:26.99]Bitch, you get (no love, no love, no love, no love)
[02:34.35]Bitch, you get (no love, no love, no love)
[02:39.60]And I don't need you (no more); get 'em!
[02:42.34]【Verse 2: Eminem】
[02:42.35]I'm alive again
[02:43.66]More alive than I have been, in my whole entire life
[02:46.66]I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
[02:50.90]I'm a little bit sicker than, most
[02:52.78]Shit's finna get thick again
[02:54.10]They say the competition is stiff
[02:55.70]But I get a hard dick from this shit, and I stick it in
[02:58.00]I ain't never givin' in again
[02:59.66]Caution to the wind, complete freedom
[03:01.55]Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
[03:03.05]So why the fuck would I join them when I beat 'em?
[03:05.45]They call me a freak
[03:06.35]'Cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
[03:08.88]Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage
[03:10.75]Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
[03:12.50]Snatch the mic from 'em
[03:13.55]Bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah, that rap was tight
[03:16.00]But I'm 'bout spit the greatest verse of all time
[03:17.95]So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
[03:20.15]Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit
[03:21.80]And start over from scratch and write new ones
[03:23.70]But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
[03:25.35]When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
[03:27.20]It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
[03:28.88]From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
[03:31.10]Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
[03:32.95]You can see the sparks from hot metal
[03:34.75]Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
[03:36.95]My soul started to rot, fellow
[03:38.35]When I'm not even in my harshest
[03:39.95]You can still get roasted, 'cause Marsh is not mellow
[03:41.95]'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not going to stop
[03:43.88]I'm standin' on my Monopoly board
[03:46.00]That means I'm on top of my game
[03:47.55]And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore
[03:49.88]When you're so good that you can't say it
[03:51.35]Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
[03:53.66]People just get sick ‘cause you spit
[03:55.10]These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
[03:57.20]And you can never break my stride
[03:58.45]You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
[04:00.35]I'm 'bout to blow; you'll never take my pride
[04:02.30]Killin' the flow, slow venom
[04:03.20]And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
[04:06.00]Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
[04:07.79]I don't give a fuck: keep giving 'em hell
[04:09.45]Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
[04:11.40]You get no love
[04:12.34]【Hook: Eminem and Lil Wayne】
[04:12.35]It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
[04:15.80]You kicked me when I was down
[04:17.75]But what you say just (don't hurt me)
[04:20.00]That's right (don't hurt me)
[04:21.30]And I don't need you (no more)
[04:23.20]Don't want to see you (no more)
[04:25.55]Bitch, you get (no love)
[04:26.88]You showed me nothin' but hate, you ran me into the ground
[04:30.55]But what comes around goes around
[04:32.55]I don't need you (don't hurt me)
[04:34.77]That's right (don't hurt me)
[04:36.20]And I don't need you (no more)
[04:37.99]Don't want to see you (no more)
[04:40.30]Bitch, you get (no love, no love, no love, no love)
[04:47.77]Bitch, you get (no love, no love, no love)
[04:52.83]And I don't need you (no more)
[04:54.66]Ha! Bitch, you get no love
