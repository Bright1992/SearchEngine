[00:17.960]We touch I feel a rush
[00:20.130]We clutch it isn't much
[00:21.470]But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us

[00:43.300]Walk down this road all alone
[00:44.940]It's noones fault but my own
[00:46.510]It's the path I've chosen to go
[00:48.240]Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
[00:51.510]Don't ask me why I have no love for these mufuckin' hos
[00:55.260]Bloodsuckin suckubusses what the fuck is up with this
[00:58.120]I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this

[01:03.880]Like tryin to start over
[01:05.100]I gotta hole in my heart I'm some kind of emotional rollercoaster
[01:08.900]Something I won't go on til you toy with my emotion so it's over

[01:58.060]Theres no limit on how far I would go
[01:59.890]No boundries no lengths
[02:02.200]Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
[02:05.660]Gonna be that one and then once we get em it's never the same
[02:09.360]You want them when they don't want you
[02:10.440]Soon as they do feelings change
[02:12.180]It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
[02:16.210]I wasn't lookin' but I stumbled onto you mustve been fate
[02:19.620]But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
[02:22.390]Let's cut to the chase
[02:23.390]But a door shuts in your face

[02:27.270]That I won't be makin' a mistake

[03:06.820]But I love you so much it hurts
[03:08.800]Never mistreated you once
[03:10.490]I poured my heart out to you
[03:12.200]Let down my guard swear to god
[03:13.820]I'll blow my brains in your lap
[03:15.550]Lay here and die in your arms
[03:17.260]Drop to my knees and I'm bleeding.
[03:19.000]I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
[03:20.680]You won't even listen so fuck it
[03:21.930]I'm tryin to stop you from breathin'
[03:23.580]I put both hands on your throat
[03:25.300]I sit on top of you squeezin'
[03:26.920]Til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
[03:30.040]Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house
[03:33.450]And let you live
[03:34.330]Tears streamed down both of my cheeks
[03:35.640]Then I let you just go and just give
[03:37.240]And before I put that gun to my temple
[03:38.970]I told you this
[03:40.120]
[03:41.120]And I would do anything for you
[03:44.350]To show you how much I adored you
[03:48.220]But it's over now
[03:50.030]It's too late to save our love
[03:52.620]Just promise me youll think of me everytime you look up in the sky and see a star cause I'm a
[03:57.300]

[04:02.220]And I'm aiming right at you.
[04:07.110]Right at you
[04:10.450]250,000 miles on a clear night in June.
[04:15.990]And I'm so lost without you
