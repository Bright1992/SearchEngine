[00:00.300]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[00:05.650]But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
[00:11.530]Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
[00:16.860]But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
[00:25.430]I can't tell you what it really is
[00:27.190]I can only tell you what it feels like
[00:29.230]And right now it's a still night in my wind pipe
[00:31.850]I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
[00:34.740]As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
[00:37.440]High off the law, drunk from my hate,
[00:39.520]It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
[00:42.770]And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
[00:46.300]She fucking hates me and I love it.
[00:48.450]Wait! Where you going? I'm leaving you
[00:51.160]No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.
[00:53.750]Here we go again
[00:54.690]It's so insane cus when its going good its going great.
[00:56.830]I'm superman with the wind at his back
[00:58.790]Shes Louis Lane but when its bad its awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
[01:02.940]Whos that dude? I don't even know his name
[01:05.100]I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
[01:07.800]I guess I don't know my own strength
[01:10.090]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[01:15.100]But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
[01:21.100]Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
[01:26.190]But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
[01:43.400]You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
[01:46.220]When you're with 'em
[01:47.250]You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
[01:49.440]Got that warm fuzzy feeling
[01:50.690]Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
[01:51.960]Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him
[01:54.030]You swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him
[01:56.370]Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
[02:00.600]You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him
[02:03.040]Throw him down pin him
[02:04.570]So lost in the moments when you're in them
[02:06.160]It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat
[02:08.180]So they say you're best to go your separate ways
[02:10.330]Guess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday
[02:12.920]Yesterday is over it's a different day
[02:15.030]Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
[02:17.780]Next time you show restraint
[02:19.340]You don't get another chance
[02:20.520]Life is no Nintendo game
[02:22.050]But you lied again
[02:23.030]Now you get to watch her leave out the window
[02:25.100]I guess that's why they call it window pain
[02:26.650]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[02:31.740]But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
[02:37.690]Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
[02:42.820]But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
[03:00.130]Now I know he said things hit things that we didn't mean
[03:02.850]And we fall back into the same patterns same routine
[03:06.420]But your temper's just as bad as mine is
[03:08.540]You're the same as me
[03:09.600]But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
[03:11.320]Baby, please come back
[03:12.570]It wasn't you, baby it was me
[03:14.410]Maybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed
[03:17.120]Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
[03:20.210]All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
[03:22.910]Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
[03:25.500]Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
[03:28.480]I told you this is my fault
[03:29.770]Look me in the eye ball
[03:31.180]Next time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall
[03:34.080]Next time. There won't be no next time
[03:36.150]I apologize even though I know its lies
[03:38.580]I'm tired of the games I just want her back
[03:41.010]I know I'm a liar
[03:42.130]If she ever tries to fucking leave again
[03:43.780]Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
[03:47.410]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[03:52.500]But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
[03:58.420]Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
[04:03.590]But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
[04:14.270]I love the way you lie
