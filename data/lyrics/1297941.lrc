[00:00.590]Lately I've been hard to reach
[00:03.800]I've been too long on my own
[00:06.450]everybody has a private world
[00:10.120]Where they can be alone
[00:14.280]Are you calling me are you trying to get through
[00:21.160]Are you reaching out for me and I'm reaching out for you
[00:29.050]I'm just so fuckin' depressed
[00:30.660]I just can seem to get out this slump
[00:32.410]If I could just get over this hump
[00:34.190]But I need something to pull me out this dump
[00:36.120]I took my bruises took my lumps
[00:37.870]Fell down and I got right back up
[00:39.710]But I need that spark to get psyched back up
[00:41.440]And the right thing for me to pick that mic back up
[00:43.390]I don't know how I pry away
[00:45.190]And I ended up in this position I'm in
[00:46.950]I starting to feel distant again
[00:48.730]So I decided just to beat this pain
[00:50.650]Up and tried to make an attempt to vent
[00:52.890]But I just can't admit
[00:54.190]Or come to grips with the fact that
[00:56.270]I may be done with rap
[00:57.100]I need a new outlet
[00:58.500]I know some shits so hard to swallow
[01:00.180]But I just can't sit back and wallow
[01:02.140]In my own sorrow
[01:03.090]But I know one fact
[01:04.080]I'll be one tough act to follow
[01:05.430]One tough act to follow
[01:07.590]One tough act to follow
[01:07.640]Copy
[01:09.100]Here today gone tomorrow
[01:11.270]But you have to walk a thousand miles
[01:13.450]Walk my shoes just to see
[01:14.840]What it's like to be me
[01:16.650]All be you let's trade shoes
[01:18.500]Just to see what I'd be like to
[01:20.530]Feel your pain you feel mine
[01:22.090]Go inside each other's mind
[01:23.910]Just to see what we find
[01:25.770]Looking shit through each other's eyes
[01:28.210]But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful OoOo
[01:35.480]They can all get fucked Just stay true to you sOoOoo
[01:42.660]Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful OoOo
[01:49.990]They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you
[01:56.050]I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
[01:58.510]Everything is so tense and gloom
[02:00.370]I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
[02:03.170]Just as soon as I walk in
[02:04.500]It's like all eyes on me
[02:05.660]So I try to avoid any eye contact
[02:07.510]Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation
[02:10.100]Like I want that
[02:12.180]I'm not looking for extra attention
[02:13.990]I just want to be just like you
[02:15.670]Blend in with the rest of the room
[02:17.280]Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
[02:19.270]I don't need fucking man servin'
[02:21.020]Tryin to follow me around and wipe my ass
[02:22.970]Laugh at every single joke I crack
[02:24.750]And half of them ain't even funny like that
[02:26.600]Ahh Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian god damn
[02:30.330]Unfortunately I am but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
[02:34.250]So why don't you all sit down
[02:35.970]Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
[02:37.550]Hell we don't have to trade our shoes
[02:39.480]And you don't have to walk no thousand miles
[02:41.680]Walk my shoes just to see
[02:43.010]What it's like to be me
[02:44.840]All be you let's trade shoes
[02:46.700]Just to see what I'd be like to
[02:48.690]Feel your pain, you feel mine
[02:50.320]Go inside each other's mind
[02:52.110]Just to see what we find
[02:53.920]Looking shit through each other's eyes
[02:56.460]But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful OoOo
[03:03.590]They can all get fucked Just stay true to you sOoOoo
[03:10.770]Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful OoOo
[03:18.080]They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you sOoOoo
[03:24.950]Nobody asked for life to deal us
[03:26.790]With these bullshit hands with doubt
[03:28.450]We have to take these cards ourselves
[03:30.210]And flip them don't expect no help
[03:32.060]Now I could have either just
[03:34.090]Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
[03:35.890]But take this situation in which I'm placed in
[03:38.200]And get up and get my own
[03:39.400]I was never the type of kid
[03:41.100]To wait but I know to unpack his bags
[03:42.900]Never sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
[03:44.830]For a dad to show up who never did
[03:46.670]I just wanted to fit in
[03:48.300]Every single place
[03:49.300]Every school I went
[03:50.220]I dreamed of being that cool kid
[03:52.030]Even if it meant acting stupid
[03:53.860]Aunt Edna always told me
[03:55.470]Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that
[03:57.640]Meanwhile I'm just standing there
[03:59.150]Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this
[04:01.240]Till I stuck my tungue on the frozen stop sign poll at 8 years old
[04:04.900]I learned my lesson and cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
[04:08.420]But I already told you my whole life story
[04:10.190]Not just based on my description
[04:12.100]Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
[04:13.930]Is probably 110% different
[04:15.780]I guess we would have to walk a mile In each other's shoes at least
[04:19.390]What size you where
[04:20.330]I wear tens
[04:21.190]Let's see if you can fit your feet

[04:26.600]All be you let's trade shoes
[04:28.440]Just to see what I'd be like to
[04:30.300]Feel your pain you feel mine
[04:32.130]Go inside each other's mind
[04:33.890]Just to see what we find
[04:35.700]Looking shit through each other's eyes
[04:38.270]But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful OoOo
[04:45.280]They can all get fucked Just stay true to you sOoOoo
