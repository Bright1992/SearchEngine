[00:02.530]My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
[00:08.140]the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
[00:14.150]And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
[00:20.240]it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[00:26.770]My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all

[00:55.640]I sent two letters back in autumn You must not have got 'em
[00:58.570]There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
[01:01.540]
[01:01.720]Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
[01:04.520]But anyways, fuck it, what's been up man, how's your daughter?
[01:07.580]My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm out to be a father
[01:10.070]If I have a daughter, guess what I'm-a call her? I'm-a
[01:12.850]name her Bonnie.
[01:13.620]
[01:13.820]I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
[01:16.410]I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't wanthim.
[01:19.520]I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggestfan.
[01:22.820]I even got the underground shit that you did with Scam.
[01:25.620]
[01:25.960]I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man.
[01:28.900]I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was fat.

[01:38.370]My tears gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
[01:44.050]the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all

[01:56.090]it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[02:00.370]
[02:01.230]Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote,
[02:03.730]I hope you have the chance.
[02:04.750]I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans.
[02:07.850]If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert
[02:10.470]You didn't have to but you could have signed an autograph for Matthew.
[02:13.560]That's my little brother, man. He's only 6 years old.
[02:15.720]We waited in the blistering cold for you for 4 hours and ya just said no.
[02:19.810]That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
[02:22.710]He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more
[02:24.830]than I do.
[02:25.520]
[02:25.700]I ain't that mad, but I just don't like bein' lied to.
[02:28.550]Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I write you
[02:31.480]You would write back. See, I'm just like you in a way.
[02:33.820]I never knew my father neither.
[02:35.630]He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her.
[02:37.770]
[02:37.970]I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs.
[02:40.390]So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on.
[02:43.350]Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit help when I'm depressed.
[02:46.480]I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest.
[02:49.170]
[02:49.590]Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds.
[02:52.600]It's like adrenaline. The Pain is such a sudden rush for me.
[02:55.140]See, everything you say is real, and I respect you
[02:58.000]'cause you tell it.
[02:58.550]My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7.
[03:01.530]But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does.
[03:04.330]She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up.
[03:07.410]You've gotta call me man. I'll be the biggest fan
[03:09.440]you'll ever lose.
[03:10.250]Sincerely yours, Stan. PS: We should be together too.
[03:13.380]
[03:13.550]My tears gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
[03:20.030]the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
[03:26.030]And even if I could it'd all be great, to put your picture on my wall
[03:32.040]it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[03:36.810]
[03:37.050]Dear Mr. "I'm too good to call or write my fans"
[03:40.270]This'll be the last package I ever send your ass.
[03:43.390]It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?
[03:46.000]I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect.
[03:49.480]
[03:49.670]So this is my cassette I'm sending you. I hope you hear it.
[03:52.140]I'm in the car right now. I'm doing 90 on the freeway.
[03:55.380]Hey Slim, "I drank a fifth of vodka, ya dare me to drive?"
[03:58.900]You know that song by Phil Collins from "The Air In The Night"?
[04:01.850]About that guy who could have saved that other guy fromdrowning?
[04:04.690]But didn't? Then Phil saw it all then at his show he found him?
[04:07.580]That's kinda how this is. You could have rescued me fromdrowning.
[04:10.470]Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy.
[04:13.040]
[04:13.290]And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call.
[04:16.340]I hope you know I ripped all o' your pictures off the wall.
[04:19.530]I love you Slim, we could have been together. Think about it.
[04:22.920]You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it.
[04:26.050]And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it.
[04:29.000]I hope your conscious eats at you and you can't breathe without me.
[04:32.380]See Slim, {screaming} shut up bitch, I'm trying to talk
[04:34.560]Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk.
[04:37.490]But I didn't slit her throat,
[04:38.760]I just tied her up, see I ain't like you.
[04:40.560]'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more,
[04:42.710]and then she'll die too.
[04:43.880]Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now.
[04:46.750]Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
[04:49.800]
[04:50.740]{screeching tires, crashing sounds, car splashes into thewater}
[04:59.490]
[05:01.890]My tears gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
[05:08.060]the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
[05:14.050]And even if I could it'd all be great, but your picture on my wall
[05:20.180]it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[05:24.950]
[05:25.530]Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy.
[05:28.480]You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
[05:31.560]Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that.
[05:34.420]And here's an autograph for your brother:
[05:36.010]I wrote it on your Starter cap.
[05:37.590]
[05:37.880]I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you.
[05:40.910]Don't think I did that shit intentionally, just to diss you.
[05:43.920]And what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
[05:47.050]I say that shit just clownin' dawg,
[05:48.570]c'mon, how fucked up is you?
[05:49.900]You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
[05:52.550]To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some.
[05:55.720]
[05:56.120]And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
[05:58.220]That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other.
[06:01.450]I really think you and your girlfriend need each other.
[06:04.400]Or maybe you just need to treat her better.
[06:06.860]I hope you get to read this letter.
[06:08.520]I just hope it reaches you in time.
[06:10.330]Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'd be doin' just fine
[06:13.290]If you'd relax a little. I'm glad that I inspire you, but Stan
[06:16.460]Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan.
[06:20.070]I just don't want you to do some crazy shit.
[06:22.530]I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick.
[06:25.680]Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
[06:28.470]And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was
[06:30.370]pregnant with his kid
[06:31.350]And in the car they found a tape but it didn't say who it was to
[06:34.360]Come to think about it...his name was...it was you.
[06:37.550]Damn.
[06:40.030]
[06:40.320]
