[00:11.280]Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo… (3x)
[00:19.670]
[00:21.780]We had the best years of our lives,
[00:26.060]But you and I would never be the same,
[00:31.710]September took me by surprise,
[00:36.500]And I was left to watch the seasons change.
[00:41.540]
[00:42.330]Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo… (3x)
[00:50.740]
[00:52.780]It's been so quiet since you've gone,
[00:57.350]And everyday feels more like a year,
[01:02.980]Sometimes I wish I could move on,
[01:07.820]The memories would all just disappear.
[01:12.370]
[01:13.540]So many things I should've,
[01:16.080]Said when I had the chance,
[01:18.650]So many times we took it all for granted.
[01:23.500]
[01:24.040]I'd never thought this could ever end,
[01:26.460]I'd never thought I'd lose my best friend,
[01:29.120]Everything is different now,
[01:31.200]Can we stop the world from turning?
[01:34.080]
[01:34.550]I'd never thought I'd have to let you go,
[01:36.860]I'd Never thought I'd ever feel this low,
[01:39.800]I Wish I could go back,
[01:41.800]And we'd stop the world from turning.
[01:46.050]
[01:47.000]Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo… (2x)
[01:49.600]
[01:50.390]Looking back on better days,
[01:54.830]When we were young, we thought we knew so much.
[02:00.450]And now it seems so far away,
[02:05.190]I'm wondering If I was good enough.
[02:09.770]
[02:10.770]So many things I should've,
[02:13.400]Said when I had the chance,
[02:16.340]So many times we took it all for granted.

[02:44.740]
[02:49.120]Gone are all the days,
[02:51.430]When we swore we'd never break,
[02:54.020]And now I'm left here alone.
[02:57.800]
[02:59.320]Gone are all the days,
[03:01.690]When we swore we'd never break,
