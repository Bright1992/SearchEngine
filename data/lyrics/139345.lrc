[00:24.000]It's cold cold world
[00:26.000]I can't feel,I can't be real and now
[00:28.500]I need something
[00:31.000]maybe I gotta start up
[00:33.000]hates become my only dollar
[00:35.000]I can't move I can't see but with the devil I gotta barter
[00:39.000]I am numb wanna drown in rum
[00:41.000]wanna fill my lung cause I am so so heart-strong
[00:45.000]my heart swollen and down I'm rolling
[00:48.000]this hand up over the beast and death is looking golden now
[00:52.670]总算是流干了眼泪
[00:58.860]总算习惯了残忍
[01:05.400]太阳每天都照常升起
[01:11.790]在烂醉的清晨
[01:18.080]像早前的天真梦想
[01:24.560]被时光损毁
[01:31.010]再没什么能让我下跪
[01:37.400]我们笑着灰飞烟灭
[01:42.350]人如鸿毛
[01:45.320]命若野草
[01:48.500]无可救药
[01:50.980]卑贱又骄傲
[01:55.070]无所期待
[01:58.190]无可乞讨
[02:01.330]命运如刀
[02:03.740]就让我来领教
[02:08.000]it's cold cold world
[02:09.000]waking up in the morning my first thought is about my life
[02:13.000]the same stress and strife
[02:15.000]misery is my wife
[02:16.500]cause I'm living in a club
[02:18.000]nightmare and my soul is on death row but
[02:22.000]I've sweating regret so I drink to forget
[02:25.000]I must follow my fears on and up hill
[02:27.000]battle down a dead and street
[02:30.000]but now I'm smiling you know
[02:31.000]I can't frown
[02:33.000]I need air but I wanna drown
[02:35.170]总算是流干了眼泪
[02:41.440]总算习惯了残忍
