[00:03.429]北风从今夜开始吹起
[00:14.300]我的心灯火闪闪忽明忽暗
[00:23.600]怎么说起又怎能说清这漫长迷茫的夏季
[00:33.119]当那聚会要散去时该谁远行谁不醒
[00:43.489]And time pass by
[00:48.309]And time pass by
[00:53.289]看这就是让我迷失的那座城市
[01:03.619]舞步如梦恍惚
[01:12.919]醉的人们呀举起杯笑着眼里都是泪
[01:22.869]谁在晚餐后老去像迷雾里我的心
[01:33.179]My life is in mud
[01:38.179]My life is in mud
[01:43.699]
[02:04.329]Can you help me Can you help me
[02:14.0]Can you help me Can you help me
[02:23.930]Can you help me Can you stop me
[02:29.790]Do you believe me
[02:34.700]Can you feel me So far so near
[02:38.790]So you lead me
[02:44.200]Can you hear me Can you stop me
[02:48.970]Do you believe me
[40:41.490]
