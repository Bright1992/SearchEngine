[00:58.872]Well let the geek in the pink take a stab at it
[01:01.302]If you like the way I'm thinking  baby wink at it
[01:03.599]I may be skinny at times but I'm fat for rhymes
[01:06.009]Pass me the mic and I'm a grab at it

[01:10.177]This baby listen to this
[01:11.357]don't wanna miss it while it's hittin'
[01:13.307]Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in
[01:15.027]So don't ever quit
[01:16.154]cause soon I'm gonna let you in but see
[01:18.034]I don't care what you think about me
[01:22.334]You can vibe without me if you want
[01:26.694]I could be the one to take you home
[01:29.184]Baby we could rock the night alone
[01:31.634]If we never get down it wouldn't be a let down
[01:34.024]But sugar don't forget what you already know
[01:36.504]
[01:41.474]Don't judge me by the color, confuse it for another
[01:44.154]You might regret what you let slip away

[01:56.409]Well this relationship fodder don't mean to bother nobody
[01:58.809]But Cupid's automatic musta fired multiple shots at her
[02:01.999]Because she fall in love too often that's what the matter
[02:04.259]At least I talk about it keep a pattern of flattery and
[02:07.139]She was starin' through the doorframe
[02:09.279]Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend
[02:11.889]Well she can get her toys outta the drawer then
[02:14.039]Cause I ain't comin' home
[02:14.859]I don't need that attention, see
[02:16.759]
[02:25.559]I could be the one to take her home
[02:28.159]Baby we could rock the night alone
[02:30.439]If we never get down it wouldn't be the let down
[02:32.819]But sugar don't forget what you already know
[02:35.549]I could be the one to turn you on
[02:37.859]You could be the talk across the town
[02:40.589]Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
[02:43.239]You might regret what you let slip away more than you think
[02:47.601]Hey baby look at me go
[02:50.281]From zero to hero
[02:52.691]You better take it from a geek like me
[02:55.271]Well I can save you from unoriginal dum-dums
[03:00.331]Who wouldn't care if you com...plete him or not
[03:06.263]So what I've got a short attention span
[03:07.913]A coke in my hand
[03:08.753]Because I'd rather have the afternoon,
[03:10.363]relax and understand
[03:11.533]My hip hop and flip-flops
[03:12.893]it don't stop with the light rock
[03:14.463]A shot to mock you kinda puts me in the tight spot
[03:16.933]The hype is nothing more than hoo-ha so
[03:18.853]I'm developing a language and I'm callin' it my own
[03:21.883]So take a peek into the speaker
[03:23.473]and you'll see what I mean
[03:24.473]That on the other side the grass is greener
[03:27.133]I don't care what you might think about me
[03:31.843]You'll get by without me if you want
[03:36.273]I could be the one to take you home
[03:39.083]Baby we could rock the night alone
[03:41.263]If we never get down it wouldn't be the let down
[03:43.993]But sugar don't forget what you already know
[03:46.253]I could be the one to turn you on
[03:48.993]We could be the talk across the town
[03:51.423]Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
[03:54.203]You might regret what you let slip away
