[00:17.11]Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
[00:20.82]In the lane, snow is glistening
[00:23.61]
[00:24.50]A beautiful sight,
[00:25.58]
[00:26.24]We＇re happy tonight,
[00:27.78]Walking in a winter wonderland.
[00:29.66]
[00:31.87]Gone away is the bluebird,
[00:35.70]In his place is a new bird
[00:38.34]
[00:39.12]He sings a love song,
[00:41.06]As we go along,
[00:42.67]Walking in a winter wonderland.
[00:44.76]
[00:47.95]In the meadow we can build a snowman
[00:50.84]Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
[00:54.04]He＇ll say: Are you married?
[00:55.48]We＇ll say: No man,
[00:57.29]But you can do the job
[00:59.09]When you＇re in town.
[01:00.30]Later on, we＇ll conspire,
[01:03.30]
[01:03.82]As we dream by the fire
[01:06.11]
[01:06.83]To face unafraid,
[01:09.28]The plans that we＇ve made,
[01:10.82]Walking in a winter wonderland.
