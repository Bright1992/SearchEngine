[00:13.420]See I never thought that I could walk through fire
[00:18.750]I never thought that I could take the burn
[00:23.690]I never had the strength to take it higher
[00:28.690]Until I reached the point of no return
[00:32.280]
[00:33.710]And there's just no turning back
[00:35.970]When your hearts under attack
[00:38.470]Gonna give everything I have
[00:40.950]It's my destiny
[00:43.350]
[00:44.160]I will never say never! (I will fight)
[00:49.250]I will fight till forever! (make it right)
[00:54.600]Whenever you knock me down
[00:56.280]I will not stay on the ground
[00:58.910]Pick it up
[00:59.360]Pick it up
[00:59.920]Pick it up
[01:00.570]Pick it up up up
[01:02.120]And never say never
[01:04.629]
[01:13.240]I never thought I could feel this power
[01:18.600]I never thought that I could feel this free
[01:23.200]I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
[01:27.880]And I'm fast enough to run across the sea
[01:31.289]
[01:32.770]And there's just no turning back
[01:35.280]When your hearts under attack
[01:37.840]Gonna give everything I have
[01:40.259]Cause this is my destiny
[01:42.940]
[01:43.490]I will never say never!(I will fight)
[01:48.160]I will fight till forever!(make it right)
[01:53.110]Whenever you knock me down
[01:55.570]I will not stay on the ground
[01:58.150]Pick it up
[01:58.620]Pick it up
[01:59.200]Pick it up
[01:59.810]Pick it up, up, up
[02:01.400]And never say never
[02:03.560]
[02:04.000]Here we go!
[02:04.950]Guess who?
[02:05.620]JSmith and Jb!
[02:07.900]I gotcha lil bro
[02:08.770]I can handle him
[02:09.919]Hold up, aight?
[02:11.240]I can handle him
[02:12.390]
[02:12.580]Now he's bigger than me
[02:13.990]Taller than me
[02:15.100]And he's older than me
[02:16.390]And stronger than me
[02:17.520]And his arms a little bit longer than me
[02:19.590]But he ain't on a JB song with me!
[02:22.340]I be trying a chill
[02:22.600]
[02:23.300]They be trying to side with the thrill
[02:24.590]No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
[02:26.810]
[02:27.790]Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove
[02:29.760]Like Cobe with the 4th, ice water with blood
[02:31.800]
[02:32.000]I gotta be the best, and yes
[02:33.310]We're the flyest
[02:35.490]Like David and Goliath
[02:39.600]I conquered the giant
[02:40.220]So now I got the world in my hand
[02:42.110]I was born from two stars
[02:43.060]So the moon's where I land
[02:44.220]
[02:44.890]I will never say never!(I will fight)
[02:50.200]I will fight till forever!(make it right)
[02:54.750]Whenever you knock me down
[02:57.100]I will not stay on the ground
[02:59.550]Pick it up
[03:00.020]Pick it up
[03:00.560]Pick it up
[03:01.800]Pick it up, up, up
[03:02.440]And never say never
[03:04.840]
[03:05.660]I will never say never!(I will fight)
[03:09.830]I will fight till forever!(make it right)
[03:15.500]Whenever you knock me down
[03:17.280]I will not stay on the ground
[03:19.590]Pick it up
[03:20.300]Pick it up
[03:20.890]Pick it up
[03:21.550]Pick it up, up, up
[03:23.490]And never say never
[03:26.520]Never say never
[03:28.060]Never say never
[03:30.680]Never say never
[03:33.080]Never say never
