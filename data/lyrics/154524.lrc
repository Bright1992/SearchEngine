[00:28.210]If the sky opened up for me
[00:33.870]And the mountains disappeared
[00:40.760]If the seas ran dry turned to dust
[00:47.490]And the sun refused to rise
[00:54.990]I would still find my way
[01:01.720]By the light I see in your eyes
[01:08.860]The world I know fades away but you stay
[01:16.660]As the earth reclaims its due
[01:20.220]And the cycle starts anew
[01:22.960]We’ll stay. always
[01:26.990]In the love that we have shared before time
[01:43.330]If the years take away
[01:48.520]Every memory that I have
[01:56.210]I would still know the way That would lead me back to your side.
[02:09.720]The North Star may die
[02:16.820]But the light that I see in your eyes
[02:27.270]Will burn there always
[02:30.690]Lit by the love we have shared before time
[02:39.210](When the forest turns to jade)
[02:42.220](And the stories that we’ve made)
[02:48.860](Dissolve away( One shining light will still remain
[02:53.570](When we shed our earthly skin)
[02:55.800](And when our real life begins)
[02:59.210](There’ll be no shame)
[03:02.700]Just the love that we have made before time
