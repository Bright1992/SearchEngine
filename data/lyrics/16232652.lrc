[00:07.500]I felt it
[00:08.690]The wire touched my neck and
[00:10.560]Then someone pulled it tighter
[00:12.560]I never saw it coming
[00:14.500]I'm certain to back out and
[00:16.370]Then someone said good morning
[00:18.310]I took it as a warning
[00:20.430]I should have seen it coming
[00:22.250]So now I'll take a chance on
[00:24.370]This thing we may have started
[00:26.270]Intentional or not I
[00:28.140]Don't think we saw it coming
[00:30.170]It's all adding up to something
[00:32.490]That ask of some involvement
[00:33.990]That ask for our commitment
[00:35.990]I think I see it coming
[00:37.800]If we step out of that limb
[00:39.670]My heart beat beats me senselessly
[00:43.340]Why's everything got to be so intense with me
[00:47.410]I'm trying to handle all these unpredictability
[00:52.330]In all probability
[00:54.450]It's a long shot so I say why not
[00:58.780]If I say forget it
[01:00.150]I know that I'll regret it
[01:02.900]It's a long shot just to beat the odds
[01:06.560]The chance is we won't make it
[01:08.310]But I know if I don't take it there's no chance
[01:12.560]Cuz you're the best I got
[01:18.160]So take the long shot
[01:23.270]I realize that there is all this starting
[01:26.140]Things we're both scared about
[01:28.020]We'll never see them coming
[01:30.130]Throw caution to the wind and
[01:32.000]We'll see which way it's blowing
[01:34.060]And to this pulling on
[01:36.020]We'll never see it coming
[01:37.710]Until it's much to close to stop
[01:39.650]My heart beat beats me senselessly
[01:43.270]Why's everything got to be so intense with me
[01:47.620]I'm trying to handle all these unpredictability
[01:52.830]And all probability

[02:13.180]Cuz I'm the best you got
[02:17.060]So take the long shot
[02:26.020]Oh I waited for fact to come of fiction
[02:29.870]And you fit my description
[02:31.810]I never saw you coming
[02:34.000]But we'll make it even though
[02:34.620]It's a long shot but I say why not
[02:39.600]If I say forget it
