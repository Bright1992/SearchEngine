[00:13.980]Guess this means you’re sorry
[00:16.930]You’re standing at my door
[00:20.450]Guess this means you take back
[00:23.700]All you said before
[00:27.140]Like how much you wanted
[00:30.320]Anyone but me
[00:33.560]Said you’d never come back
[00:36.690]But here you are again
[00:41.370]Cuz we belong together now...yeah
[00:47.680]Forever united here somehow...yeah
[00:54.610]You got a piece of me
[00:58.660]And honestly
[01:00.740]My life would suck without you
[01:07.790]Maybe I was stupid for telling you goodbye
[01:14.600]Maybe I was wrong for tryin’ to pick a fight
[01:21.300]I know that I’ve got issues
[01:23.890]But you’re pretty messed up too
[01:27.900]Either way, I found out I’m nothing without you

[01:41.740]Forever united here somehow...yeah
[01:48.540]You got a piece of me
[01:52.720]And honestly

[02:03.630]Being with you is so dysfunctional
[02:08.938]I really shouldn’t miss you, but I can’t let go
[02:31.589]Cuz we belong together now...yeah
[02:38.790]Forever united here somehow...yeah
[02:44.869]You got a piece of me
[02:49.619]And honestly
[02:52.179]My life would suck without you
[02:58.309]Cuz we belong together now...yeah
