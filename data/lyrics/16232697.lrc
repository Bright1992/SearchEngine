[00:15.490]I will not make the same mistakes that you did
[00:22.580]I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
[00:29.070]I will not break the way you did
[00:33.570]You fell so hard
[00:36.490]I learned the hard way, to never let it get that far
[00:43.360]Because of you
[00:44.910]I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[00:50.120]Because of you
[00:51.730]I learned to play on the safe side
[00:54.320]So I don't get hurt
[00:56.980]Because of you
[00:58.660]I find it hard to trust
[01:00.490]Not only me, but everyone around me
[01:04.150]Because of you
[01:07.310]I am afraid
[01:12.650]I lose my way
[01:15.030]And it's not too long before you point it out
[01:19.480]I cannot cry
[01:21.820]Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
[01:26.420]I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh
[01:30.730]Every day of my life
[01:33.220]My heart can't possibly break
[01:35.740]When it wasn't even whole to start with
[01:39.900]Because of you
[01:41.520]I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[01:46.690]Because of you
[01:48.210]I learned to play on the safe side
[01:50.970]So I don't get hurt
[01:53.560]Because of you
[01:55.210]I find it hard to trust
[01:56.840]Not only me, but everyone around me
[02:00.670]Because of you
[02:03.900]I am afraid
[02:07.520]I watched you die
[02:09.000]I heard you cry
[02:11.000]Every night in your sleep
[02:14.480]I was so young
[02:16.070]You should have known better than to lean on me
[02:21.340]You never thought of anyone else
[02:24.770]You just saw your pain
[02:28.290]And now I cry
[02:30.010]In the middle of the night
[02:33.500]for the same damn thing
[02:39.660]Because of you
[02:41.600]I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[02:46.930]Because of you
[02:48.550]I learned to play on the safe side
[02:50.940]So I don't get hurt
[02:53.860]Because of you
[02:55.290]I tried my hardest just to forget everything
[03:00.530]Because of you
[03:02.070]I don't know how to let anyone else in
[03:07.300]Because of you
[03:09.110]I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
[03:14.200]Because of you
[03:16.590]I am afraid
[03:21.490]Because of you
