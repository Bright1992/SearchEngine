[00:12.920]I cannot find a way
[00:16.390]To describe it
[00:17.710]It's there
[00:18.830]Inside
[00:20.130]All I do is hide
[00:22.600]I wish
[00:23.740]That it
[00:24.920]Would just go away
[00:27.320]What would
[00:28.520]You do?
[00:29.710]You do?
[00:30.040]If you knew...
[00:32.200]What would you do?
[00:35.290]All the pain
[00:38.260]I thought I knew
[00:38.880]All these thoughts lead back to you
[00:40.950]Back to what
[00:41.950]Was never said
[00:43.440]Back and forth

[01:02.290]Like I
[01:04.290]Am alone
[01:05.980]All by
[01:07.390]Myself
[01:08.430]I need to get around this
[01:10.840]My words
[01:12.170]Are cold
[01:13.290]I don't want them to hurt you
[01:15.620]If I
[01:16.850]Show you
[01:17.960]I don't think you'd understand
[01:20.580]Cause no one understsands

[01:25.930]]I thought I knew
[01:27.070]All these thoughts lead back to you
[01:29.460]Back to what
[01:30.780]Was never said
[01:31.920]Back and forth
[01:32.900]Inside my head
[01:34.910]I can't handle this confusion
