[00:01.930]Remember when I cried
[00:04.940]to you a thousand times
[00:08.140]I told you everything
[00:11.400]You know my feelings
[00:14.470]It never crossed my mind
[00:17.670]That there would be a time
[00:20.880]For us to say goodbye
[00:23.820]What a big surprise
[00:26.940]But I'm not lost
[00:30.110]I'm not gone
[00:33.150]I haven't forgot
[00:38.260]These feelings I can't shake no more
[00:41.540]These feelings are running out the door
[00:44.770]I can feel it falling down
[00:47.830]And I'm not coming back around
[00:51.000]These feelings I can't take no more
[00:54.460]This emptiness in the bottom drawer
[00:57.550]It's getting harder to pretend
[01:00.750]And I'm not coming back around again
[01:19.300]I remember when
[01:22.320]It was together til the end
[01:25.590]Now I'm alone again
[01:28.790]Where do I begin?
[01:31.950]I cried a little bit
[01:34.960]You died a little bit
[01:38.280]Please say there's no regrets
[01:41.440]And say you won't forget
[01:44.540]But I'm not lost
[01:47.700]And I'm not gone
[01:50.720]I haven't forgot
[01:56.200]These feelings I can't shake no more
[01:59.700]These feelings are running out the door
[02:03.030]I can feel it falling down
[02:06.080]And I'm not coming back around
[02:09.310]These feelings I can't take no more
[02:15.160]This emptiness in the bottom drawer
[02:18.420]It's getting harder to pretend
[02:21.770]And I'm not coming back around again
[02:29.860]Remember when
[02:36.260]That was then, now it's the end
[02:38.860]I'm not coming back
[02:41.000]I can't pretend
[02:42.810]Remember when
[02:49.600]There feelings I can't shake no more
[02:52.780]These feelings are running out the door
[02:55.900]I can feel it falling down
[02:58.880]And I'm not coming back around
[03:02.070]These feelings I can't take no more
[03:05.470]This emptiness in the bottom drawer
[03:08.900]It's getting harder to pretend
[03:11.830]And I'm not coming back around again
