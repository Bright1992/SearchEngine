[00:21.170]I couldn't tell you why she felt that way,
[00:27.220]She felt it everyday.
[00:31.540]And I couldn't help her,
[00:34.340]I just watched her make the same mistakes again.
[00:40.830]What's wrong, what's wrong now?
[00:43.340]Too many, too many problems.
[00:45.980]Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs.
[00:52.160]She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
[00:57.250]It's where she lies, broken inside.
[01:02.100]With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
[01:09.730]Broken inside.
[01:12.900]Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why.
[01:23.190]You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind.
[01:32.690]Be strong, be strong now.
[01:35.320]Too many, too many problems.
[01:37.830]Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs.
[01:44.050]She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
[01:46.560]It's where she lies, broken inside.
[01:54.240]With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
[02:01.980]Broken inside.
[02:07.080]Her feelings she hides.
[02:09.330]Her dreams she can't find.
[02:11.840]She's losing her mind.
[02:14.480]She's fallen behind.
[02:17.080]She can't find her place.
[02:19.490]She's losing her faith.
[02:22.140]She's fallen from grace.
[02:24.920]She's all over the place.
[02:29.240]Yeah,oh
[02:42.970]She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
[02:42.980]It's where she lies, broken inside.
[02:43.650]With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
[02:51.250]Broken inside.
[02:53.600]She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh yeah
[03:03.800]She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh yeah
