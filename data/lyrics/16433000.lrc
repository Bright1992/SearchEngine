[00:29.530]Childhood living
[00:36.120]Is easy to do
[00:42.900]The things that you wanted
[00:50.640]Well I bought them for you
[00:53.990]
[00:58.940]Graceless lady
[01:05.470]You know who I am
[01:12.810]You know I can't let you
[01:20.100]Just slide through my hands
[01:24.710]
[01:28.200]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[01:42.840]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[01:53.770]
[01:58.170]I watched you suffer
[02:04.750]A dull aching pain
[02:11.680]And now you've decided
[02:19.220]To show me the same
[02:23.420]
[02:26.510]No sweeping exits
[02:33.590]Or offstage lines
[02:40.830]Could make me feel bitter
[02:48.530]Or treat you unkind
[02:55.820]
[02:56.420]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[03:11.050]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[03:22.240]
[03:26.700]I know I've dreamt you
[03:33.980]A sin and a lie
[03:41.070]And I have my freedom
[03:48.350]But I don't have much time
[03:52.460]
[03:56.310]Fate has been suffered
[04:03.240]And tears must be cried
[04:10.270]So let's do some living
[04:18.530]After we die
[04:26.270]
[04:26.530]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[04:43.230]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[04:59.420]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[05:14.310]And wild horses couldn't drag me away
[05:45.840]
