[00:07.10]I've made up my mind,
[00:10.23]No need to think it over,
[00:12.95]If i'm wrong I aint right,
[00:16.68]No need to look no further,
[00:19.94]This ain't lust,
[00:21.76]I know
[00:25.27]This is love but,
[00:32.70]If i tell the world,
[00:35.98]I'll never say enough,
[00:38.39]Cause it was not said to you,
[00:41.35]And thats exactly what i need to do,
[00:45.22]If i'm in love with you,
[00:51.16]Should i give up,
[00:53.48]Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
[00:57.25]Even if it leads nowhere,
[01:01.67]Or would it be a waste?
[01:04.09]Even If i knew my place should i leave it there?
[01:10.86]Should i give up,
[01:12.62]Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
[01:17.05]Even if it leads nowhere
[01:23.69]yeah~~~~
[01:26.24]I'd build myself up,
[01:29.57]And fly around in circles,
[01:32.02]Wait then as my heart drops,
[01:35.09]and my back begins to tingle
[01:38.10]finally could this be it
[01:43.37]Should i give up,
[01:47.14]Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
[01:51.05]Even if it leads nowhere,
[01:55.29]Or would it be a waste?
[01:58.21]Even If i knew my place should i leave it there?
[02:04.49]Should i give up,
[02:06.65]Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
[02:10.87]Even if it leads nowhere
