[00:06.010]There's a fire starting in my heart
[00:10.700]Reaching a fever pitch
[00:12.540]And it's bringing me out the dark
[00:14.750]Finally I can see you crystal clear
[00:19.430]Go ahead and sell me out
[00:21.550]And I'll lay your ship (shit) bare
[00:23.480]
[00:23.950]See how I'll leave,
[00:26.170]with every piece of you
[00:28.350]Don't underestimate
[00:30.639]the things that I will do
[00:32.910]There's a fire starting in my heart
[00:37.590]Reaching a fever pitch
[00:39.800]And it's bringing me out the dark
[00:41.670]
[00:44.100]The scars of your love remind me of us
[00:47.810]They keep me thinking
[00:49.810]that we almost had it all
[00:52.300]The scars of your love,
[00:54.550]they leave me breathless
[00:56.790]I can't help feeling...
[00:59.100]
[00:59.310]We could have had it all
[01:03.930]Rolling in the deep
[01:08.480]You had my heart inside of your hands
[01:12.850]And you played it to the beat
[01:18.030]
[01:18.840]Baby, I have no story to be told
[01:23.120]But I've heard one on you
[01:25.400]Now I'm gonna make your head burn
[01:27.730]Think of me in the depths of your despair
[01:32.320]Make a home down there
[01:34.620]As mine sure won't be shared
[01:36.679]
[01:37.929]The scars of your love remind me of us
[01:42.580]They keep me thinking
[01:44.670]that we almost had it all
[01:48.100]The scars of your love,
[01:49.410]they leave me breathless
[01:51.700]I can't help feeling
[01:53.850]
[01:54.140]We could have had it all
[01:58.590]Rolling in the deep
[02:03.900]You had my heart inside of your hands
[02:07.700]And you played it to the beat
[02:12.850]
[02:13.000]Could have had it all
[02:16.930]Rolling in the deep
[02:21.430]You had my heart inside of your hands
[02:26.080]But you played it with a beating
[02:31.100]
[02:32.080]Throw your soul through every open door
[02:36.480]Count your blessings
[02:38.570]to find what you look for
[02:41.070]Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
[02:45.470]You pay me back in kind
[02:47.820]and reap just what you've sown
[02:50.640](You're gonna wish you never had met me)
[02:50.990]
[02:53.870]We could have had it all
[02:55.310](Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[02:58.360]We could have had it all
[02:59.890]
[03:00.080](You're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:03.900]It all, it all, it all, it all
[03:06.990](Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[03:06.990]
[03:07.300]We could have had it all
[03:11.850]Rolling in the deep
[03:11.850](You're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:16.700](Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[03:16.700]You had my heart inside of your hands
[03:21.020](You're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:21.020]And you played it to the beat
[03:25.740](Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[03:25.740]
[03:25.880]Could have had it all
[03:30.150](You're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:30.150]Rolling in the deep
[03:34.570](Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[03:34.570]You had my heart inside of your hands
[03:39.800](You're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:39.800]But you played it, you played it,
[03:42.300]You played it, you played it to the beat
[03:46.960]
