[00:01.600]My old man is a bad man
[00:03.390]But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
[00:06.330]And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
[00:13.020]He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
[00:16.020]He doesn't mind I have a L.A crass way about me
[00:19.990]He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
[00:23.210]
[00:24.880]Swimming pool
[00:25.630]Wipe bikini off with my red nail polish
[00:27.960]Glimmering darling
[00:29.880]Watch me in the swimming pool
[00:31.410]Bright blue ripples, you
[00:32.970]Sittin' sippin' on your black crystal, oh yeah
[00:35.290]
[00:36.690]Light of my life, fire of my loins
[00:39.220]Be a good baby, do what I want
[00:42.650]Light of my life, fire of my loins
[00:45.690]Gimme them gold coins
[00:47.290]Gimme them coins
[00:48.460]And I'm off to the races, cases of Bacardi chasers,
[00:50.000]
[00:51.640]Chasin' me all over town
[00:53.940]Cause he knows I'm wasted, facin'
[00:56.180]Time again on Rikers
[00:57.680]Island and I won't get out
[00:59.370]
[01:00.170]Because I'm crazy, baby
[01:03.400]I need you to come here and save me
[01:05.950]I'm your little scarlet, starlet
[01:08.160]Singing in the garden,
[01:09.660]Kiss me on my open mouth
[01:11.940]Ready for you
[01:13.190]
[01:15.980]My old man is, a tough man
[01:18.870]But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
[01:21.910]And he shows me, he knows me,
[01:24.320]every inch of my tar black soul
[01:27.940]He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
[01:31.040]In fact he says he thinks
[01:32.580]it's why he might like about me, admires me
[01:36.400]The way I roll like a rolling stone
[01:38.470]
[01:39.110]Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
[01:41.450]Chateau Marmont
[01:42.650]Slippin' on my red dress, putting on my make up
[01:45.570]Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac
[01:48.650]Fumes, says it feels like heaven to him
[01:51.320]
[01:51.890]Light of his life, fire of his loins
[01:54.650]Keep me forever, tell me you own me
[01:57.690]Light of your life, fire of your loins
[02:00.670]Tell me you own me, gimme them coins
[02:02.900]And I'm off to the races, cases of Bacardi chasers
[02:03.010]
[02:06.640]Chasin' me all over town
[02:09.050]Cause he knows I'm wasted, facin'
[02:11.180]Time again on Rikers
[02:12.700]Island and I won't get out
[02:14.280]
[02:15.200]Because I'm crazy, baby
[02:18.540]I need you to come here and save me
[02:21.810]I'm your little scarlet, starlet
[02:22.740]Singing in the garden,
[02:24.630]Kiss me on my open mouth
[02:26.330]
[02:26.870]Now I'm off to the races, laces
[02:29.110]Leather on my waist is
[02:30.590]Tight and I am falling down
[02:32.930]I can see your face is, shameless
[02:35.090]Cipriani's basement
[02:36.630]Love you, but I'm going down
[02:38.370]
[02:39.140]God I'm so crazy, baby
[02:42.520]I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
[02:44.930]I'm your little harlot, starlet
[02:47.130]Queen of Coney Island
[02:48.670]Raising hell all over town
[02:50.910]Sorry 'bout it
[02:52.220]
[02:55.270]My old man is a thief, and
[02:57.730]I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
[03:03.530]But I trust in the decision of the Lord,
[03:07.290]To watch over us
[03:10.020]Take him when He may, if He may
[03:13.050]I'm not afraid to say
[03:15.220]That I'd die without him
[03:17.630]Who else is gonna put up with me this way
[03:21.640]I need you, I breathe you, I'll never leave you
[03:24.580]They would rue the day, I was alone without you
[03:29.350]
[03:30.260]You're lying with your gold chain on
[03:32.830]Cigar hanging from your lips
[03:34.280]I said Hon' you never looked so beautiful
[03:38.930]As you do now my man
[03:41.050]
[03:41.770]And we're off to the races, places
[03:44.210]Ready, set, the gate is down
[03:45.750]And now we're going in
[03:48.260]To Las Vegas, pay us,
[03:50.170]Casino Oasis,
[03:51.710]Honey it is time to spin
[03:53.950]Boy you're so crazy, baby
[03:57.400]I love you forever
[03:59.150]Not maybe
[04:00.020]You are my one true love
[04:02.890]You are my one true love
[04:04.970]
[04:23.340]You are my one true love
