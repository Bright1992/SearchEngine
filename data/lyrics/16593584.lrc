[00:28.15]Money is the anthem of success
[00:30.68]So before we go out, what's your address?
[00:33.56]I'm your National Anthem
[00:35.38]God, you're so handsome
[00:36.80]Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
[00:39.52]He loves to romance them
[00:41.20]Reckless abandon
[00:42.39]Holding me for ransom, Upper echelon
[00:45.0]He says to be cool but
[00:46.84]I don't know how yet
[00:47.98]Wind in my hair
[00:49.45]Hand on the back of my neck
[00:51.53]I said, "Can we party later on", he said "Yes, yes, yes"
[00:56.63]Tell me I'm your National Anthem
[00:59.64]Ooh yeah baby, bow down
[01:00.94]Making me so wild now
[01:02.25]Tell me I'm your National Anthem
[01:05.44]Sugar, sugar, how now
[01:06.42]Take your body downtown
[01:07.83]Red, white, blue's in the sky
[01:10.66]Summer's in the air and baby heaven's in your eyes
[01:14.6]I'm your National Anthem
[01:19.2]Money is the reason we exist
[01:21.84]Everybody knows it, it's a fact, kiss, kiss
[01:24.45]I sing the National Anthem
[01:26.3]While I'm standing
[01:27.59]Over your body, hold you like a python
[01:30.33]And you can't keep your hands off
[01:32.8]Me or your pants on
[01:33.46]See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
[01:35.75]He said to be cool but
[01:37.59]I'm already coolest
[01:38.82]I said to get real
[01:40.16]Don't you know who you're dealing with
[01:42.5]Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
[01:47.31]Tell me I'm your National Anthem
[01:50.17]Ooh yeah baby, bow down
[01:51.61]Making me so wild now

[02:01.29]Summer's in the air and baby heaven's in your eyes
[02:04.92]I'm your National Anthem
[02:10.3]It's a love story for the new age, for the six page
[02:13.35]We're on a quick, sick rampage
[02:15.50]Wining and dining, drinking and driving
[02:18.31]Excessive buying, overdose and dying
[02:21.19]On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
[02:23.92]Blurring the lines between real and the fake
[02:26.93]Dark and lonely
[02:29.57]I need somebody to hold me
[02:32.51]He will do very well
[02:35.24]I can tell, I can tell
[02:38.11]Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
[02:43.86]Money is the anthem of success
[02:46.47]So put on mascara, and your party dress
[02:49.34]I'm your National Anthem
[02:51.17]Boy, put your hands up
[02:52.48]Give me a standing ovation
[02:55.4]Boy, you have landed
[02:56.61]Babe, in the land of
[02:58.5]Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon
[03:00.65]Tell me I'm your National Anthem
[03:03.66]Ooh yeah baby, bow down
[03:05.23]Making me so wild now
[03:06.34]Tell me I'm your National Anthem
[03:09.25]Sugar, sugar, how now
[03:10.83]Take your body downtown
[03:12.2]Red, white, blue's in the sky
[03:14.79]Summer's in the air and baby heaven's in your eyes
[03:18.31]I'm your National Anthem
