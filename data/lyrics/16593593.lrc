[00:01.00]Let's get out of this town, baby we're on fire
[00:07.80]Everyone around here seems to be going down, down

[00:21.81]It feels like all of our friends are lost
[00:24.32]Nobody's found, found, found
[00:29.04]I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
[00:35.74]You came along, scooped me up like a baby
[00:43.91]Every now and then, the stars align
[00:47.33]Boy and girl meet by the great design
[00:50.77]Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
[00:58.10]Everybody told me love was blind

[01:33.97]But baby, nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down

[02:34.48]Falling in love for the first time
[02:36.81]Feels like, you know, it feels like
