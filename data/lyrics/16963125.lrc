[00:05.430]We took it all apart
[00:06.520]But I'm wishing I'd stayed
[00:09.530]In the back room something I heard you say
[00:17.790]We didn't want to call it too early
[00:23.480]Now it seems a world away
[00:26.210]But I miss the thing' are we ever gonna feel the same?
[00:32.150]
[00:33.090]Standing in the light till it's over
[00:36.690]Out of our minds
[00:37.850]Someone had to draw a line
[00:40.830]We'll be coming back for you one day
[00:44.990]We'll be coming back for you one day
[00:49.200]I don't even care if I know you
[00:51.600]Out of our minds
[00:52.890]Got to leave it all behind
[00:56.090]We'll be coming back
[00:57.800]We'll be coming back for you one day
[01:05.220]
[01:40.400]You can see it from afar
[01:43.730]We were riding that wave
[01:47.410]Blinded by the lights' and it's something not great
[01:52.940]We didn't want to call it too early
[01:57.470]Now it seems a world away
[01:59.880]But I miss the thing' are we ever gonna feel the same?
[02:05.230]
[02:07.860]Standing in the light till it's over
[02:10.470]Out of our minds
[02:12.390]Someone had to draw a line
[02:15.080]We'll be coming back for you one day
[02:19.390]We'll be coming back for you one day
[02:22.370]I don't even care if I know you
[02:25.310]Out of our minds
[02:26.730]Got to leave it all behind
[02:29.840]We'll be coming back for you one day
[02:33.870]We'll be coming back for you one day
[02:37.920]
[02:47.610]Gonna rise' gonna fall' getting pulled apart
[02:50.450]And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
[02:54.240]Gonna light up the skies' or ignore the stars
[02:58.300]And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
[03:01.690]
[03:16.770]Standing in the light till it's over
[03:19.700]Out of our minds
[03:20.560]Someone had to draw a line
[03:23.720]We'll be coming back for you one day
[03:27.360]We'll be coming back for you one day
[03:31.129]I don't even care if I know you
[03:33.970]Out of our minds
[03:35.660]Got to leave it all behind
[03:38.600]We'll be coming back for you one day
[03:42.400]We'll be coming back for you one day
[03:46.379]
