[00:29.169]She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
[00:33.190]I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
[00:38.740]Who will dance on the floor in the round
[00:43.680]She said I am the one
[00:46.930]who will dance on the floor in the round
[00:53.850]She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
[00:57.810]Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
[01:03.380]Who will dance on the floor in the round
[01:07.150]
[01:09.939]People always told me be careful of what you do
[01:13.760]And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
[01:17.950]And mother always told me be careful of who you love
[01:22.160]And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
[01:26.890]Billie Jean is not my lover
[01:30.630]She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
[01:35.870]But the kid is not my son
[01:41.900]She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
[01:51.189]For forty days and for forty nights
[01:53.830]The law was on her side
[01:55.320]But who can stand when she's in demand
[01:57.740]Her schemes and plans
[02:00.610]'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
[02:06.200]So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
[02:12.989](Do think twice)
[02:15.859]She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
[02:19.619]Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
[02:25.249]'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
[02:31.809]People always told me be careful of what you do
[02:35.920]And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
[02:40.190]She came and stood right by me
[02:41.899]Then the smell of sweet perfume
[02:43.939]This happened much too soon
[02:46.190]She called me to her room
[02:48.789]Billie Jean is not my lover
[02:52.549]She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
[02:57.709]But the kid is not my son
[03:05.200]Billie Jean is not my lover
[03:08.909]She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
[03:14.200]But the kid is not my son
[03:19.599]She says I am the one
[03:22.369]but the kid is not my son
[03:44.109]She says I am the one
[03:46.859]but the kid is not my son
[03:54.349]Billie Jean is not my lover
[03:58.890]She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
[04:03.260]But the kid is not my son
[04:08.519]She says I am the one
[04:11.629]but the kid is not my son
[04:16.690]She says I am the one
[04:24.849]She says I am the one
[04:27.200]Billie Jean is not my lover
[04:31.300]Billie Jean is not my lover
[04:35.280]Billie Jean is not my lover
[04:38.890]Billie Jean is not my lover
[04:44.990]Billie Jean is not my lover
