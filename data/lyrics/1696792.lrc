[00:36.86]There’s a ghost down in the hall
[00:38.95]There’s a ghoul upon the bed
[00:41.31]There’s something in the walls
[00:43.54]There’s blood up on the stairs
[00:46.01]And it’s floating through the room
[00:48.16]And there’s nothing I can see
[00:50.54]And I know it’s bless the tune
[00:52.79]Because now it’s haunting me
[00:54.85][00:58.95][01:31.69][01:36.14][02:36.65][02:41.54]Don’t understand it
[01:13.73][02:19.13]There’s a thumpin’ in the floor
[01:16.02][02:21.00]There’s a creak behind the door
[01:18.44][02:23.75]There’s a rocking in the chair
[01:20.65]But there’s no-one seem there
[01:22.93][02:27.93]There’s a ghostly smell around
[01:25.21][02:30.33]But nobody to be found
[01:27.54][02:32.49]And a coffin inlay open
[01:29.83]Where a restless soul is pokin’
[01:38.85][02:43.28][02:49.58](Got a ghost

[02:00.18][03:04.91][04:09.72][04:28.75]And who gave you the right to shake my fablic tree?
[02:04.89]They put a knife in my back
[02:06.03][03:29.27][04:34.60]Shot an arrow in me
