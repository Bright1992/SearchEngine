[00:05.180]（Michael）
[00:12.227]Every  night  she  walks  right  in  my  dreams
[00:14.667]Since  I  met  her  from  the  start
[00:17.677]I'm  so  proud  I  am  the  only  one
[00:20.437]Who  is  special  in  her  heart
[00:23.117]The  girl  is  mine
[00:28.347]The  doggone  girl  is  mine
[00:34.957]I  know  she's  mine
[00:39.507]Because  the  doggone  girl  is  mine
[00:42.527]（Paul）
[00:47.377]I  don't  understand  the  way  you  think
[00:49.897]Saying  that  she's  yours  not  mine
[00:53.137]Sending  roses  and  your  sill  dreams
[00:55.937]Really  just  a  waste  of  time
[00:58.537]Because  she's  mine
[01:04.07]The  doggone  girl  is  mine
[01:10.437]Don't  waste  your  time
[01:15.157]Because  the  doggone  girl  is  mine
[01:22.217]I  love  you  more  than  he
[01:25.617]（Take  you  anywhere）
[01:26.247]（Michael）
[01:28.227]But  I  love  you  endlessly
[01:30.07]（Loving  we  will  share）
[01:33.597]（Michael &Paul）
[01:34.897]So  come  and  go  with  me
[01:37.17]Two  on  the  town
[01:38.747]（Michael）
[01:40.77]But  we  both  cannot  have  her
[01:42.927]So  it's  one  or  the  other
[01:46.27]And  one  day  you'll  discover
[01:48.757]That  she's  my  girl  forever  and  ever
[01:52.347]（Paul）
[01:52.717]Don't  build  your  hopes  to  be  let  down
[01:55.107]'Cause  I  really  feel  it's  time
[01:57.487]（Michael）
[01:57.917]I  know  she'll  tell  you  I'm  the  one  for  her
[02:01.597]'Cause  she  said  I  blow  her  mind
[02:03.197]The  girl  is  mine
[02:08.897]The  doggone  girl  is  mine
[02:15.217]Don't  waste  your  time
[02:19.967]Because  the  doggone  girl  is  mine
[02:23.157]（Michael &Paul）
[02:23.807]She's  mine,she's  mine
[02:25.427]No,no,no,she's  mine
[02:27.47]The  girl  is  mine,the  girl  is  mine
[02:30.127]The  girl  is  mine,the  girl  is  mine
[02:32.557]（Paul）

[02:35.866]The  girl  is  mine,（yes）she's  mine
[02:42.206]（Michael）

[02:49.261]Because  the  doggone  girl  is  mine
[02:54.231]The  girl  is  mine,the  girl  is  mine
[02:58.661]（Paul）
[02:59.441]Michael,we're  not  going  to  fight  about  this,okay
[03:03.321]（Michael）
[03:03.641]Paul,I  think  I  told  you,I'm  a  lover  not  a  fighter
[03:06.341]（Paul）
[03:08.121]I've  heard  it  all  before,Michael,she  told  me  that  I'm  her  forever  lover,
[03:12.371]You  know,don't  you  remember
[03:14.621]（Michael）
[03:14.801]Well,after  loving  me,she  said  she  couldn't  love  another
[03:16.801]（Paul）
[03:16.981]Is  that  what  she  said
[03:18.361]（Michael）
[03:18.781]Yes,she  said  it,you  keep  dreaming
[03:20.241]（Paul  sings）
[03:20.771]I  don't  believe  it
[03:22.371]（Michael &Paul）
