[00:14.149]There is a time when we should heed a certain call
[00:20.579]Cause the world it seems it’s right in this line
[00:27.420]Cause there’s a chance for taking in needing our own lives
[00:34.300]It seems we need nothing at all
[00:41.309]I used to feel that I should give away my heart
[00:48.149]And it shows that fear of needing them
[00:55.499]Then I read the headlines and it said they’re dying there
[01:02.499]And it shows that we must heed instead
[01:08.440]We are the world
[01:11.800]We are the children
[01:15.169]We are the ones who make a brighter day
[01:18.380]So let’s start giving
[01:22.199]But there’s a chance we’re taking
[01:26.149]We’re taking our own lives
[01:29.800]It’s true we’ll make a brighter day just you and me
[01:34.780]
[01:40.560]Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
[01:46.840]Cause you know that they can feed them all
[01:54.399]Then I read the paper and it said that you’ve been dying
[02:00.710]And it shows the second we will call
[02:07.149]We are the world
[02:10.559]We are the children
[02:13.919]We are the ones who make a brighter day
[02:17.899]So let’s start giving

[02:35.319]No there’s a time when we must love them all
[02:42.420]And it seems that life, it don’t make love at all
[02:48.889]But if you’d be there, and I’ll love you more and more
[02:56.990]It seems in life,I didn’t do that
[03:02.379]We are the world
[03:05.729]We are the children
[03:09.990]We are the ones who make a brighter day
