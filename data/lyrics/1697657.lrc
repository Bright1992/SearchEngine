[00:56.000]I was wandering in the rain
[01:00.000]Mask of life' feelin' insane
[01:03.000]Swift and sudden fall from grace
[01:07.000]Sunny days seem far away
[01:11.000]Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
[01:13.000]Stalin's tomb won't let me be
[01:18.000]On and on and on it came
[01:22.000]Wish the rain would just let me
[01:24.000]How does it feel （How does it feel）
[01:28.000]How does it feel
[01:31.700]How does it feel
[01:34.700]When you're alone
[01:36.700]And you're cold inside
[01:43.700]Here abandoned in my fame
[01:47.300]Armageddon of the brain
[01:51.300]KGB was doggin' me
[01:55.300]Take my name and just let me be
[01:58.300]Then a begger boy called my name
[02:02.300]Happy days will drown the pain
[02:06.300]On and on and on it came
[02:09.300]And again' and again' and again...
[02:10.300]Take my name and just let me be
[02:12.300]How does it feel （How does it feel）
[02:16.300]How does it feel
[02:20.300]How does it feel
[02:24.300]How does it feel
[02:27.300]How does it feel （How does it feel now）
[02:31.300]How does it feel
[02:34.300]How does it feel
[02:38.300]When you're alone
[02:39.300]And you're cold inside
[03:15.300]How does it feel （How does it feel）
[03:19.300]How does it feel
[03:22.300]How does it feel
[03:26.300]How does it feel
[03:30.300]How does it feel （How does it feel now）
[03:34.300]How does it feel
[03:37.300]How does it feel
[03:41.300]When you're alone
[03:42.300]And you're cold inside
[03:47.300]Like stranger in Moscow
[03:55.300]Like stranger in Moscow
[04:02.300]We're talkin' danger
[04:05.300]We're talkin' danger' baby
[04:09.300]Like stranger in Moscow
[04:16.300]We're talkin' danger
[04:20.300]We're talkin' danger' baby
[04:24.300]Like stranger in Moscow
[04:31.300]I'm live in lonely
[04:35.300]I'm live in lonely' baby
[04:39.300]Stranger in Moscow
[05:29.300]
