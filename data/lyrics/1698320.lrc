[00:00.87]Another day has gone
[00:04.84]I'm still all alone
[00:08.71]How could this be
[00:12.57]You're not here with me
[00:16.59]You never said goodbye
[00:20.59]Someone tell me why
[00:24.60]Did you have to go
[00:28.59]And leave my world so cold
[00:34.32]Everyday I sit and ask myself
[00:38.29]How did love slip away
[00:42.48]Something whispers in my ear and says
[00:48.49]That you are not alone
[00:52.47]For I am here with you
[00:56.56]Though you're far away
[01:00.55]I am here to stay
[01:04.50]You are not alone
[01:08.42]I am here with you
[01:12.44]Though we're far apart
[01:16.06]You're always in my heart
[01:20.89]You are not alone
[01:26.86]All alone
[01:33.58]Why, oh
[01:40.77]Just the other night
[01:44.76]I thought I heard you cry
[01:48.76]Asking me to come
[01:52.53]And hold you in my arms
[01:56.83]I can hear your prayers
[02:00.78]Your burdens I will bear
[02:04.73]But first I need your hand
[02:08.45]So forever can begin
[02:14.39]Everyday I sit and ask myself
[02:18.53]How did love slip away
[02:22.92]Then something whispers in my ear and says
[02:28.77]That you are not alone
[02:32.79]For I am here with you
[02:36.82]Though you're far away
[02:40.74]I am here to stay
[02:44.82]For you are not alone
[02:48.88]I am here with you
[02:52.85]Though we're far apart
[02:56.78]You're always in my heart
[03:00.73]And you are not alone
[03:05.82]Oh...
[03:07.39]Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
[03:13.79]Fly...
[03:15.64]And girl you know that I'll be there
[03:22.14]I'll be there
[03:28.94]You are not alone
[03:32.81]I am here with you
[03:36.90]Though you're far away
[03:40.88]I am here to stay
[03:44.71]You are not alone
[03:48.61]I am here with you
[03:52.72]Though we're far apart
[03:56.62]You're always in my heart
[04:00.67]You are not alone(You are not alone)
[04:04.95]For I am here with you(I am here with you)
[04:08.93]Though you're far away(Though you're far away)
[04:13.18]I am here to stay(And you with me)
[04:17.20]For you are not alone(You're always)
[04:19.25]In my heart.....For I am here with you
[04:23.37]Heart.....Though we're far apart
[04:27.33]Heart.....You're always in my heart
[04:32.70]For you are not alone
[04:35.97]Not alone
[04:39.86]You are not alone, you are not alone...
[04:47.98]You are not alone, you are not alone...
[04:52.19]Not alone, not alone
[04:56.28]You just reach for me girl
[04:58.98]In the morning in the evening
[05:03.20]Not alone, not alone
[05:06.53]And you with me, not alone
[05:10.15]Oh, together, together...
