[00:42.500]Think about, um, the generations,and their,
[00:48.270]Say we wanna make it a better place for our children,
[00:51.010]And our childrens' children
[00:53.300]So that they, they know what is a better world for them
[00:58.200]And think they can make it a better place
[01:02.180]————————————-
[01:09.010]There's a place in your heart
[01:11.450]And I know that it is love
[01:14.620]And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
[01:19.420]And if you really try
[01:22.780]You'll find there's no need to cry
[01:26.160]In this place you'll feel
[01:28.850]There's no hurt or sorrow
[01:32.410]There are ways to get there
[01:35.390]If you care enough for the living
[01:38.130]Make a little space
[01:41.230]Make a better place
[01:43.860]Heal the world
[01:46.100]Make it a better place
[01:49.300]For you and for me
[01:53.320]And the entire human race
[01:55.980]There are people dying
[01:59.270]If you care enough for the living
[02:02.180]Make it a better place
[02:03.840]For you and for me
[02:07.450]
[02:10.850]If you want to know why
[02:13.710]There's love that cannot lie
[02:16.670]Love is strong
[02:18.210]It only cares of joyful giving
[02:21.700]If we try we shall see
[02:25.230]In this bliss we cannot feel
[02:28.620]Fear or dread
[02:30.210]We stop existing and start living
[02:34.720]Then it feels that always
[02:37.730]Love's enough for us growing
[02:40.820]Make a better world
[02:42.830]Make a better world

[03:10.530]And the dream we were conceived in
[03:13.300]Will reveal a joyful face
[03:16.390]And the world we once believed in
[03:19.140]Will shine again in grace
[03:22.020]Then why do we keep strangling life
[03:25.790]Wound this earth, crucify its soul
[03:28.210]Though it's plain to see
[03:29.870]This world is heavenly be god's glow
[03:33.970]We could fly so high
[03:36.710]Let our spirits never die
[03:40.020]In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
[03:45.430]Create a world with no fear
[03:48.760]Together we cry happy tears
[03:51.760]We see the nations turn their swords into plowshares
[03:57.940]We could really get there
[04:01.040]If you cared enough for the living
[04:03.830]Make a little space
[04:06.940]To make a better place
[04:09.740]Heal the world
[04:12.080]Make it a better place
[04:15.160]For you and for me
[04:18.430]And the entire human race
