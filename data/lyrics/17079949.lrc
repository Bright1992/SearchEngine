[00:14.300]I miss those blue eyes
[00:17.500]How you kiss me at night
[00:20.470]I miss the way we sleep
[00:27.250]Like there's no sunrise
[00:30.100]Like the taste of your smile
[00:33.780]I miss the way we breathe
[00:38.720]But I never told you
[00:42.240]What I should have said
[00:45.470]No, I never told you
[00:48.830]I just held it in
[00:51.630]And now,
[00:53.370]I miss everything about you
[00:59.700]Can't believe that I still want you
[01:05.910]and after all the things we've been through
[01:13.539]I miss everything about you
[01:17.970]Without you
[01:27.470]I see your blue eyes
[01:30.420]Everytime I close mine
[01:33.840]You make it hard to see
[01:40.470]Where I belong to
[01:43.420]When I'm not around you
[01:47.900]It's like I'm not with me
[01:51.950]But I never told you
[01:55.430]What I should have said
[01:58.789]No, I never told you
[02:02.800]I just held it in
[02:04.910]And now,
[02:06.750]I miss everything about you
[02:13.280]Can't believe that I still want you
[02:19.910]and after all the things we've been through
[02:26.470]I miss everything about you
[02:30.950]Without you
[02:45.310]But I never told you
[02:48.530]What I should have said
[02:51.820]No, I never told you
[02:55.120]I just held it in
[02:58.140]And now,
[02:59.820]I miss everything about you
[03:06.380]Can't believe that I still want you
[03:12.940]and after all the things we've been through
[03:19.560]I miss everything about you
[03:24.790]Without you
