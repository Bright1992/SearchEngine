[00:00.00] 作曲 : MATTHEW BAIR/CARLY RAE JEPSEN/STEFAN GORDY
[00:09.020]Straight to me, you're walking to closr and it's hard to breathe
[00:14.810]I should be running, but the hurt's naive
[00:18.900]And I'll expect too much
[00:24.040]You were good to me
[00:26.160]I left a scar that no one else can see
[00:29.940]And now you're back here and reminding me that I lost way too much
[00:38.630]And you know that night I almost said I love you
[00:46.140]And you almost said it back
[00:52.100]Are we gonna be more than a memory
[00:54.800]Knowing that how lame apology
[00:58.490]I let go of you, you let go of me
[01:02.320]Are we gonna be more than a memory
[01:06.360]Are you gonna just stand in front of me
[01:09.880]Pants, and that i'm not your destiny
[01:13.730]I'm not over you, are you over me
[01:17.350]Are we gonna be more than a memory
[01:29.010]I'm not over you, are you over me
[01:32.450]Are we gonna be more than a memory
[01:39.190]Say my name, guess no one else can say it quite the same
[01:45.410]It takes me back to your september days, i've missed you, way too much
[01:54.360]Wish I was cool to you, but just to hear it breaks heart in two
[02:01.030]If there's a way to make it up to you
[02:04.050]I wanna change so much, you know I do
[02:09.380]Even though that night I almost said I love you
[02:16.810]And you almost said it back
[02:21.770]Are we gonna be more than a memory
[02:25.170]Knowing that how lame apology
[02:29.080]I let go of you, you let go of me
[02:32.870]Are we gonna be more than a memory
[02:36.900]Are you gonna just stand in front of me
[02:40.520]Pants, and that i'm not your destiny
[02:44.990]I'm not over you, are you over me
[02:47.940]Are we gonna be more than a memory
[02:51.880]Stay with me, I really need to hear you breathe
[02:58.480]If words can't speak, lay about it next to me
[03:09.920]Are we gonna be more than a memory
[03:16.130]Knowing that how lame apology
[03:20.490]I let go of you, you let go of me
[03:23.460]Are we gonna be more than a memory
[03:27.660]Are you gonna just stand in front of me
[03:31.020]Pants, and that i'm not your destiny
[03:34.920]I'm not over you, are you over me
[03:38.570]Are we gonna be more than a memory
[03:45.260]More than a memory
[03:50.930]I'm not over you, are you over me
[03:53.910]Are we gonna be more than a memory
