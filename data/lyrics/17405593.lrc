[00:17.45]Hated on by most these niggaz wit no cheese, no deals and no G's
[00:20.44]No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles, and no ski's
[00:24.96]Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries
[00:28.78]Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall full of plaques
