[00:01.10]Yeah...
[00:03.30]It's my life...
[00:05.10]My own words I guess...
[00:06.64]
[00:06.80]Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
[00:10.25]Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
[00:13.46]When they know they're your heart
[00:14.76]And you know you were their armour
[00:16.60]And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
[00:19.85]But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
[00:23.05]And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
[00:26.27]What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
[00:29.22]
[00:29.43]"Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
[00:32.62]"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
[00:35.75]I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
[00:39.10]Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
[00:42.00]I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
[00:45.45]Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
[00:48.61]And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
[00:51.80]That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
[00:55.19]Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...
[00:58.55]
[00:58.95]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[01:01.61]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[01:04.58]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[01:07.43]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[01:10.45]Just smile back
[01:11.70]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[01:14.35]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[01:17.43]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[01:20.20]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[01:23.35]Just smile back...
[01:23.99]
[01:24.00]I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
[01:27.15]She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
[01:29.77]"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"
[01:33.35]Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying
[01:36.65]"You always say that, you always say this is the last time
[01:40.25]"But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine"
[01:42.95]She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
[01:46.20]"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!"
[01:49.50]Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
[01:52.69]It's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'"
[01:56.20]I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
[01:59.00]These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
[02:02.29]They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight
[02:05.86]Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
[02:09.25]And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
[02:11.99]It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
[02:15.10]And I'm singing...
[02:15.87]
[02:15.88]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[02:18.37]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[02:21.30]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[02:24.23]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[02:27.30]Just smile back
[02:28.55]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[02:31.19]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[02:34.17]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[02:37.00]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[02:40.15]Just smile back...
[02:40.76]
[02:40.77]Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
[02:43.82]The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
[02:46.95]I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
[02:50.10]They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
[02:53.45]I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
[02:56.50]"Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,"
[02:59.75]But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
[03:03.00]"I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
[03:06.28]"You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
[03:09.49]"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
[03:12.60]"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
[03:15.75]"I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going"
[03:19.10]But baby wait, "it's too late Dad, you made the choice
[03:22.20]"Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
[03:25.25]That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
[03:29.55]It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
[03:33.45]Yeah, I bet you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
[03:38.25]I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
[03:41.33]How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
[03:44.65]I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
[03:47.85]Put it to my brain and scream "die Shady" and pop it
[03:51.00]The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
[03:57.35]That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
[04:01.30]It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
[04:05.80]Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
[04:09.85]Almost as if to say..
[04:11.10]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[04:13.57]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[04:16.59]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[04:19.38]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[04:22.45]Just smile back
[04:23.70]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[04:26.41]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[04:29.34]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[04:32.20]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[04:35.30]Just smile back...
