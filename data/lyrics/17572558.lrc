[00:02.140] [Chorus]
[00:03.139]Yeah
[00:05.000]I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
[00:10.599]But hey, what daddy always tell you?
[00:14.259]Straighten up little soldier
[00:16.670]Stiffen up that upper lip
[00:19.500]What you crying about?
[00:22.100]
[00:22.200]You got me
[00:22.630]Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
[00:25.480]Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
[00:28.540]I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
[00:31.570]I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
[00:34.290]Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?
[00:35.709]Daddy's with you in your prayers
[00:37.990]No more crying, wipe them tears
[00:38.470]Daddy's here, no more nightmares
[00:39.919]We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
[00:42.500]Laney uncles crazy, aint he?
[00:43.769]Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
[00:45.690]We're all we got in this world
[00:47.400]When it spins, when it swirls
[00:49.000]When it whirls, when it twirls
[00:49.809]Two little beautiful girls
[00:51.269]Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
[00:52.589]I know it's confusing you
[00:54.990]Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
[00:56.820]I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
[00:59.500]The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
[01:02.120]All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
[01:05.300]Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
[01:07.980]We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
[01:10.490]But things have gotten so bad between us
[01:12.899]I don't see us ever being together ever again
[01:15.000]Like we used to be when we was teenagers
[01:16.720]But then of course everything always happens for a reason
[01:19.630]I guess it was never meant to be
[01:21.450]But it's just something we have no control
[01:23.260]over and that's what destiny is
[01:25.110]But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
[01:27.619]Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
[01:30.649]Now hush little baby, don't you cry
[01:30.800]
[01:33.899]Everything's gonna be alright
[01:35.800]Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya
[01:38.570]Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
[01:42.200]I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
[01:44.779]We feel how we feel inside
[01:46.740]It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
[01:49.450]But i promise momma's gon' be alright
[01:52.140]
[01:52.589]It's funny
[01:53.500]I remember back one year when daddy had no money
[01:55.860]Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
[01:57.610]And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
[02:00.220]Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
[02:01.619]I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
[02:04.420]Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
[02:07.800]But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
[02:09.919]And at the time every house that we lived in
[02:12.300]Either kept getting broke into and robbed
[02:15.190]Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
[02:18.449]Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
[02:21.210]Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
[02:24.460]And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
[02:27.300]And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
[02:29.930]Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
[02:32.909]On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
[02:35.728]And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
[02:38.259]And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
[02:42.300]And flew you and momma out to see me
[02:44.199]But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
[02:46.780]Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
[02:50.170]And you and Laney were to young to understand it
[02:52.770]Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
[02:55.610]And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
[02:59.190]I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
[03:01.900]Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
[03:03.830]Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
[03:06.930]Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
[03:09.199]To see how much you both have grown,
[03:10.590]it's almost like you're sisters now
[03:12.409]Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
[03:15.620]Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
[03:18.440]I like the sound of that, yeah
[03:19.889]It's got a ring to it don't it?
[03:21.490]Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
[03:23.259]
[03:23.629]Now hush little baby, don't you cry
[03:26.490]Everything's gonna be alright
[03:28.300]Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya
[03:31.430]Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
[03:33.970]I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
[03:37.659]We feel how we feel inside
[03:39.620]It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
[03:42.790]But i promise momma's gon' be alright
[03:45.789]
[03:46.790]Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
[03:46.900]And if you ask me too
[03:49.400]I'mma give you the world
[03:50.920]I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
[03:52.759]I'mma sing for you
[03:53.740]I'll do anything for you to see you smile
[03:56.819]And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
[04:00.110]I'mma break that birdies neck
[04:02.150]I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
[04:04.970]And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad （haha）
[04:07.669]
[04:08.190]
[04:09.599]END
[04:09.990]
