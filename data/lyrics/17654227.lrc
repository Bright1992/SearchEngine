[00:04.000]It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
[00:12.000]I'm not one of those who can easily hide
[00:19.000]I don't have much money, but boy if I did
[00:26.000]I'd buy a big house where we both could live
[00:33.000]
[00:34.000]So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
[00:42.000]See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
[00:49.000]Anyway the thing is what I really mean
[00:56.000]Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
[01:01.000]
[01:05.000]And you can tell everybody this is your song
[01:12.000]It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
[01:19.000]I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
[01:23.000]that I put down in words
[01:27.000]How wonderful life is now you're in the world
[01:34.000]
[01:38.000]If I was a sculptor, but then again no
[01:44.000]Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show
[01:52.000]I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
[01:59.000]My gift is my song, and this one's for you
[02:12.000]
[02:29.000]And you can tell everybody this is your song
[02:36.000]It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
[02:43.000]I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
[02:47.000]that I put down in words
[02:55.000]How wonderful life is now you're in the world
