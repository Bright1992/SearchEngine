[01:57.760]Anything could happen
[02:00.070]Anything could happen
[02:02.450]Anything could happen
[02:04.690]Anything could happen
[02:07.070]Anything could happen
[02:09.450]Anything could
[02:29.900]Baby, I'll give you everything you need
[02:36.770]I'll give you everything you need, oh
[02:41.520]I'll give you everything you need
[02:46.020]But I don't think I need you
[02:48.850]Stripped to the waist
[02:50.660]We fall into the river
[02:57.850]Cover your eyes
[02:59.780]So you don't know the secret
[03:04.850]I've been trying to hide

[03:42.680]Anything could
[03:43.860]I know it's gonna be
[03:45.800]I know it's gonna be
[03:47.920]I know it's gonna be
[03:50.380]I know it's gonna be
