[00:14.450]Maybe I annoy you with my choices
[00:18.010]Well' you annoy me sometimes too with your voice
[00:24.060]But that ain't enough for me
[00:28.370]To move out and move on
[00:29.930]I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love
[00:35.850]We don't have to hurry
[00:46.150]You can take as long as you want
