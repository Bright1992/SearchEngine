[00:27.60]There's a picture on my kitchen wall
[00:30.77]Looks like Jesus and his friends involved
[00:34.36]There's a party getting started in the yard
[00:40.91]There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive
[00:47.91]Was I too young to see this with my eyes?
[00:52.44]
[00:54.41]By the pool last night, apparently
[00:58.20]The chemicals weren't mixed properly
[01:01.58]You hit your head and then forgot your name
[01:08.20]And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
[01:14.73]And now your altitude and memory's a shame
[01:19.94]
[01:22.23]What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
[01:28.51]With a little bit more of innocence
[01:31.99]I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
[01:36.66]It's okay to be easily ignored
[01:42.94]I like to believe it was all about love for a child
[01:49.80]
[01:53.63]And when the house was left in shambles
[01:57.44]Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
[02:05.63]Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around
[02:12.26]Well I'm far too old to care about that now
[02:17.91]
[02:20.00]What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
[02:26.01]With a little bit more of innocence
[02:29.40]I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
[02:34.15]It's okay to be easily ignored
[02:40.44]I'd like to believe it was all about love for a child
[02:47.79]
[02:50.71]It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce
[02:55.37]I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes
[03:03.34]And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age
[03:09.79]and they never check to see my grades
[03:13.30]What a fool I'd be to start complaining now
[03:20.82]
[03:21.19]What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
[03:26.89]With a little bit more of innocence
[03:30.23]I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
[03:35.15]It's okay to be easily ignored
[03:42.81]I'd love to believe it's all about love for a child
[03:50.97]
[03:52.21]It was all about love...
