[01:25.210]But Cupid's automatic musta fired multiple shots at her
[01:28.440]Because she fall in love too often that's what the matter
[01:30.810]At least I talk about it keep a pattern of flattery and
[01:33.710]She was starin' through the doorframe
[01:35.789]Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend
[01:38.910]Well she can get her toys outta the drawer then

[02:39.490]relax and understand
[02:40.829]My hip hop and flip-flops
[02:42.140]it don't stop with the light rock
[02:43.770]A shot to mock you kinda puts me in the tight spot
[02:46.320]The hype is nothing more than hoo-ha so I'm
[02:48.650]Developing a language and I'm callin' it my own
[02:51.579]So take a peek into the speaker
[02:52.910]and you'll see what I mean
[02:54.170]That on the other side the grass is greener
