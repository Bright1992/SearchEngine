[00:04.568]
[00:21.600]When I look into your eyes
[00:26.239]It's like watching the night sky
[00:31.538]Or a beautiful sunrise
[00:37.198]There's so much they hold
[00:42.418]And just like them old stars
[00:47.568]I see that you've come so far
[00:53.800]To be right where you are
[00:59.190]How old is your soul?
[01:01.539]
[01:03.708]I won't give up on us
[01:10.400]Even if the skies get rough
[01:14.790]I'm giving you all my love
[01:20.080]I'm still looking up
[01:22.458]
[01:25.999]And when you're needing your space
[01:29.788]To do some navigating
[01:35.590]I'll be here patiently waiting
[01:40.790]To see what you find
[01:43.880]
[01:46.189]'Cause even the stars they burn
[01:51.208]Some even fall to the earth
[01:56.479]We've got a lot to learn
[02:01.478]God knows we're worth it
[02:07.580]No, I won't give up
[02:11.380]
[02:13.528]I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
[02:17.199]I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
[02:25.590]Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
[02:28.199]The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake
[02:34.259]And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
[02:38.189]For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
[02:39.778]We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
[02:45.458]I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not
[02:49.539]And who I am
[02:54.099]
[02:55.290]I won't give up on us
[02:59.248]Even if the skies get rough
[03:04.289]I'm giving you all my love
[03:09.419]I'm still looking up
[03:12.458]Still looking up.
[03:15.599]
[03:15.889]I won't give up on us （no I'm not giving up）
[03:20.449]God knows I'm tough enough （I am tough, I am loved）
[03:25.409]We've got a lot to learn （we're alive, we are loved）
[03:32.290]God knows we're worth it （and we're worth it）
[03:34.800]
[03:36.800]I won't give up on us
[03:41.499]Even if the skies get rough
[03:46.278]I'm giving you all my love
[03:51.289]I'm still looking up
[03:54.428]
