Buju:
have a piece of body what every good gal deserve
but I won't allow this girl to mess wit my nerves
bless her figure not to mention di curves
through the corner of her eye, she slowly observe, see ah!
John:
Anytime she come around, something is about to go down
listen to the siren sound. Wake up, wake up right now.
Cause if I was to go to sleep
catch me dreaming of a way to creep
trouble always seem to follow me, oh don't follow me now
over and over and over again
I try to tell her no no no I already have a friend
over and over she's giving me heat
she said nobody has to know, I've got to let her go
so I had to walk on by, she can't be my lover
she flashes me them pretty brown eyes, she can't be my lover
though there's green grass on the other side
she can't be my lover
all I can is how she can't be my lover.
listen listen right now…
Everytime she hear the beat
she be dancing right in front of me
trying to lure me in between the sheets
I'm a man and I still get weak
I'll be damned if I lose my girl (girl)
I'll be damned if I don't touch her (touch her)
curiosity it killed the cat, oh and I don't want that so…
over and over and over again
I try to tell her no no no I already have a friend
over and over she's giving me heat
she said nobody has to know, I've got to let her go
so I had to walk on by, she can't be my lover
flashin' me them pretty brown eyes, she can't be my lover
though there's green grass on the other side
she can't be my lover
all I can is how she can't be my lover
