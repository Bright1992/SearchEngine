[00:13.550]Don't I know it? Nobody has to say
[00:19.980]I've been lucky. Guess I was born that way.
[00:27.350]I thank my father, his absence has made me strong.
[00:34.380]And I love my mother but she had troubles with God.
[00:42.060]No tears
[00:45.060]for the life that you've led
[00:48.890]You've had angels in your head
[00:52.800]Did you hear them singing in the end
[00:59.990]All the things that you've seen
[01:03.100]All the things that could have been
[01:07.370]Well I've been everything I want to be
[01:14.090]So, no tears, no tears for me
[01:21.520]
[01:26.240]Yeah, I've bathed in sunshine but cherished the fading light
[01:32.860]And I heard my heartbeat falter on a winter's night
[01:40.190]I loved a woman but she didn't hear my prayers
[01:47.870]So Lord, oh Lord, I'm yours
[01:55.460]No tears
[01:58.530]for the life that you've led
[02:01.740]You've had angels in your head
[02:06.210]Did you hear them singing in the end
[02:12.790]All the things that you've seen
[02:15.900]All the things that could have been
[02:19.910]Well I've been everything I want to be
[02:27.760]So, no tears, no tears
[02:33.580]Cause someone somewhere's going home tonight
[02:40.560]Trying to understand the sacrifice
[02:48.500]So save your tears for those left behind
[02:55.480]for the life that you've led
[02:58.440]You've had angels in your head
[03:02.150]Did you hear them singing in the end
[03:09.530]All the things that you've seen
[03:13.150]All the things that could have been
[03:16.910]Well I've been everything I want to be
[03:24.420]So, no tears, no tears
[03:33.200]No tears for me
