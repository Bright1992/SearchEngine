[00:00.00] 作词 : BLOUNT, JAMES HILLIER
[00:14.790]So while I'm turning in my sheets
[00:18.000]And once again I cannot sleep
[00:21.310]Walk out the door and up the street
[00:24.550]Look at the stars beneath my feet
[00:27.650]Remember rights that I did wrong
[00:30.780]So here I go
[00:33.490]Hello, hello
[00:36.720]There is no place I cannot go
[00:39.720]My mind is muddy but
[00:43.250]My heart is heavy does it show
[00:46.310]I lose the track that loses me
[00:49.660]So here I go
[01:11.060]And so I sent some men to fight
[01:14.400]And one came back at dead of night
[01:17.430]Said he'd seen my enemy
[01:20.560]Said he looked just like me
[01:23.660]So I set out to cut myself
[01:26.970]And here I go
[01:48.420]I'm not calling for a second chance
[01:53.470]I'm screaming at the top of my voice
[02:01.200]Give me reason, but don't give me choice
[02:06.600]Cause I'll just make the same mistake again
[02:19.570]And maybe someday we will meet
[02:22.570]And maybe talk and not just speak
[02:25.700]Don't buy the promises cause
[02:28.790]There are no promises I keep
[02:32.090]And my reflection troubles me
[02:35.300]So here I go
[02:56.470]I'm not calling for a second chance
[03:01.500]I'm screaming at the top of my voice
[03:09.220]Give me reason, but don't give me choice
[03:13.970]Cause I'll just make the same mistake
[03:21.080]I'm not calling for a second chance
[03:26.200]I'm screaming at the top of my voice
[03:33.790]Give me reason, but don't give me choice
[03:38.600]Cause I'll just make the same mistake again
[04:07.450]So while I'm turning in my sheets
[04:10.960]Uhuh uhuh uhuh
[04:13.710]And once again I cannot sleep
[04:17.240]Uhuh uhuh uhuh
[04:20.020]Walk out the door and up the street
[04:23.520]Uhuh uhuh uhuh
[04:26.270]Look at the stars
[04:29.890]Uhuh uhuh uhuh
[04:32.530]Look at the stars falling down
[04:36.390]Uhuh uhuh uhuh
[04:39.380]And I wonder where
[04:42.620]Uhuh uhuh uhuh
[04:45.690]Did I go wrong?
