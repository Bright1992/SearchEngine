[00:07.01]My life is brilliant
[00:27.98]My love is pure
[00:30.96]I saw an angel
[00:33.74]Of that I'm sure
[00:35.69]She smiled at me on the subway
[00:38.65]She was with another man
[00:41.23]But I won't lose no sleep on that
[00:44.92]'Cause I've got a plan
[00:48.36]You're beautiful
[00:51.46]You're beautiful
[00:53.97]I saw your face in a crowded place
[00:56.52]And I don't know what to do
[00:59.99]You're beautiful
[01:02.92]You're beautiful
[01:05.80]But I can't escape the truth
[01:11.89]I will never be with you
[01:19.33]
[01:26.79]Yes, she caught my eye
[01:29.99]As we walked on by
[01:33.07]She could see from my face that I was
[01:36.76]Fuckin' high
[01:38.93]And I don't think that I'll see her again
[01:44.01]But we shared a moment that will last till the end
[01:51.31]You're beautiful
[01:54.21]You're beautiful
[01:57.02]I saw your face in a crowded place
[01:59.52]And I don't know what to do
[02:03.06]You're beautiful
[02:06.08]You're beautiful
[02:09.55]But I can't escape the truth
[02:15.13]I will never be with you
[02:21.25]
[02:34.00]You're beautiful
[02:36.72]You're beautiful
[02:39.52]You're beautiful, it's true
[02:44.68]There must be an angel with a smile on her face
[02:51.45]When she thought up that I should be with you
[02:58.44]But it's time to face the truth
[03:08.18]I will never be with you
[03:15.35]
