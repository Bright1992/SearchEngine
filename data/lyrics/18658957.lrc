[00:14.570]Beautiful dawn,
[00:20.370]lights up the shore for me.
[00:24.080]There is nothing else in the world,
[00:31.110]I'd rather wake up and see (with you).
[00:38.060]Beautiful dawn,
[00:43.900]I'm just chasing time again.
[00:49.560]Thought I would die a lonely man,
[00:55.290]in the endless night.
[00:58.320]But now I'm high!
[01:04.860]running wild among all the stars above.
[01:10.680]Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me.
[01:24.970]Beautiful dawn,
[01:30.780]melt with the stars again.
[01:34.210]Do you remember the day when my journey began?
[01:41.580]Will you remember the end (of time)?
[01:48.580]Beautiful dawn,
[01:54.290]You're just blowing my mind again.
[02:00.100]Thought I was born to endless nights,
[02:05.800]until you shine.
[02:10.190]High!
[02:14.850]running wild among all the stars above.
[02:21.170]Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me.
[02:34.770]Will you be my shoulder when I'm grey and older?
[02:40.660]Promise me tomorrow starts with you,
[02:45.050]Getting high!
[02:50.190]running wild among all the stars above.
[02:56.410]Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me
[03:09.240]high!
[03:14.080]running wild among all the stars above.
[03:19.900]Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me
