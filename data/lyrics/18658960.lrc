[00:21.28]Did I disappoint you or let you down?
[00:26.11]Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
[00:30.88]'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
[00:35.07]Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.
[00:39.53]
[00:40.29]So I took what's mine by eternal right.
[00:46.27]Took your soul out into the night.
[00:51.01]It may be over but it won't stop there,
[00:55.16]I am here for you if you'd only care.
[00:59.72]
[01:00.78]You touched my heart you touched my soul.
[01:03.44]You changed my life and all my goals.
[01:05.73]And love is blind and that I knew when,
[01:08.60]My heart was blinded by you.
[01:10.69]I've kissed your lips and held your head.
[01:13.21]Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
[01:15.74]I know you well, I know your smell.
[01:18.60]I've been addicted to you.
[01:21.14]
[01:31.94][01:21.82]Goodbye my lover.
[01:34.40][01:24.36]Goodbye my friend.
[01:36.59][01:26.49]You have been the one.
[01:39.12][01:29.03]You have been the one for me.
[01:41.52]
[01:46.67]I am a dreamer but when I wake,
[01:51.61]You can't break my spirit
[01:54.23]it's my dreams you take.
[01:56.64]And as you move on, remember me,
[02:01.45]Remember us and all we used to be
[02:05.07]
[02:06.03]I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.
[02:08.53]I've watched you sleeping for a while.
[02:11.03]I'd be the father of your child.
[02:13.96]I'd spend a lifetime with you.
[02:16.18]I know your fears and you know mine.
[02:18.61]We've had our doubts but now we're fine,
[02:20.91]And I love you, I swear that's true.
[02:24.07]I cannot live without you.
[02:26.90]
[02:36.94][02:27.28]Goodbye my lover.
[02:39.77][02:29.70]Goodbye my friend.
[02:41.98][02:31.90]You have been the one.
[02:44.52][02:34.37]You have been the one for me.
[02:46.70]
[02:56.93]And I still hold your hand in mine.
[03:03.50]In mine when I'm asleep.
[03:07.10]And I will bear my soul in time,
[03:13.45]When I'm kneeling at your feet.
[03:16.67]
[03:27.39][03:17.54]Goodbye my lover.
[03:30.07][03:20.02]Goodbye my friend.
[03:32.28][03:22.20]You have been the one.
[03:34.69][03:24.73]You have been the one for me.
[03:36.77]
[03:47.16][03:37.10]I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.
[03:52.14][03:42.07]I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.
