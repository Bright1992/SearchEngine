[00:23.440]How I wish I could surrender my soul;
[00:34.370]Shed the clothes that b.e my skin;
[00:37.150]See the liar that burns within my needing.
[00:45.550]How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
[00:57.420]How I wish I had screamed out loud,
[01:00.100]Instead I've found no meaning.
[01:05.940]I guess it's time I run far, far away;
[01:12.300]find.fort in pain,
[01:15.160]All pleasure's the same:
[01:17.860]it just keeps me from trouble.
[01:20.780]Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
[01:26.489]I've heard what they say,
[01:29.500]but I'm not here for trouble.
[01:31.140]It's more than just words:
[01:34.679]it's just tears and rain.
[01:42.910]How I wish I could walk
[01:45.160]through the doors of my mind;
[01:49.310]（Hold memory close at hand）
[01:54.179]Hold memory close at hand,
[01:57.110]Help me understand the years.
[02:05.400]How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
[02:17.270]How I wish I would save my soul.
[02:20.710]I'm so cold from fear.
[02:26.370]I guess it's time I run far, far away;
[02:32.229]find.fort in pain,
[02:34.979]All pleasure's the same:
[02:38.060]it just keeps me from trouble.
[02:41.250]Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
[02:46.950]I've heard what they say,
[02:49.640]but I'm not here for trouble.
[02:52.420]Far, far away; find.fort in pain.
[02:58.900]All pleasure's the same:
[03:00.680]it just keeps me from trouble.
[03:02.930]It's more than just words:
[03:06.370]it's just tears and rain.
[03:21.570]Tears and rain
[03:29.980]Tears and rain
[03:37.870]Far, far away; find.fort in pain.
[03:44.130]All pleasure's the same:
[03:47.190]it just keeps me from trouble.
