[00:13.540]My life is brilliant.
[00:15.540]My life is brilliant.
[00:27.450]My love is pure.
[00:31.200]I saw an angel.
[00:33.140]Of that I'm sure.
[00:35.770]She smiled at me on the subway.
[00:38.500]She was with another man.
[00:42.470]But I won't lose no sleep on that,
[00:45.300]'Cause I've got a plan.
[00:48.720]You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
[00:53.590]You're beautiful, it's true.
[00:58.470]I saw you face in a crowded place,
[01:05.820]And I don't know what to do,
[01:10.630]'Cause I'll never be with you.
[01:21.789]Yeah, she caught my eye,
[01:29.640]As we walked on by.
[01:32.840]She could see from my face that I was,
[01:36.990]Flying high,
[01:39.600]And I don't think that I'll see her again,
[01:44.830]But we shared a moment that will last till the end.
[01:50.590]You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
[01:56.350]You're beautiful, it's true.
[02:00.380]I saw you face in a crowded place,
[02:08.220]And I don't know what to do,
[02:15.300]'Cause I'll never be with you.
[02:20.360]la-la-la
[02:25.490]la-la-la
[02:34.400]You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
[02:38.700]You're beautiful, it's true.
[02:44.900]There must be an angel with a smile on her face,
[02:50.100]When she thought up that I should be with you.
[03:00.580]But it's time to face the truth,
[03:06.920]I will never be with you.
