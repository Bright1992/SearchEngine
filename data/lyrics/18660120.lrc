[00:08.87]When you wake up
[00:10.74]Turn the radio on
[00:13.32]And you'll hear this simple song
[00:15.97]That I made up
[00:17.62]That I made up for you
[00:23.01]When you're driving
[00:24.76]Turn the radio up
[00:27.63]'Cause I can't sing loud enough
[00:30.18]Hard these days
[00:31.90]To get my message through
[00:37.18]If time is all I have
[00:42.95]I'll waste it all on you
[00:46.90]Each day I'll turn it back
[00:50.78]It's what the broken-hearted do
[00:53.30]I'm tired of talking to an empty space
[00:56.70]Of silences keeping me awake
[01:01.96]When you marry
[01:03.66]And you look around
[01:06.28]I'll be somewhere in that crowd
[01:09.40]Torn up, that it isn't me
[01:15.84]When you're older
[01:17.61]The memories fade
[01:20.40]I know I'll still feel the same
[01:24.64]For as long as I live
[01:29.81]And if time is all I have
[01:35.41]I'll waste it all on you
[01:39.18]Each day I'll turn it back
[01:42.96]It's what the broken-hearted do
[01:45.77]I'm tired of talking to an empty space
[01:48.95]Of silences keeping me awake
[01:53.40]Won't you say my name, one time
[01:58.11]Please just say my name
[02:04.24]If time is all I have
[02:10.41]I'll waste it all on you
[02:14.33]Each day I'll turn it back
[02:18.34]It's what the broken-hearted do
[02:21.30]I'm tired of talking to an empty space
[02:24.77]Of silences keeping me awake
[02:29.89]If time is all I have
[02:35.35]I'll waste it all on you
[02:39.05]Each day I'll turn it back
[02:42.74]It's what the broken-hearted do
[02:45.30]I'm tired of talking to an empty space
[02:48.55]Of silences keeping me awake
[02:53.37]Won't you say my name
[02:56.93]When the song is over
