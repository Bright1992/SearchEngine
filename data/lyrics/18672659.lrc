[00:11.640]Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job
[00:13.820]I make forty-some dollars a day
[00:16.940]I used to be the man in my hometown
[00:19.480]'til I started to lose my way
[00:23.480]It all goes back to when I dropped out at school
[00:26.220]Having fun, I was living the life
[00:29.100]But now I got a problem with that little white rock
[00:31.760]See I can put down the pipe
[00:34.290]
[00:34.790]And...
[00:35.350]And it's breaking me down
[00:38.130]Watching the world spin round
[00:40.960]While my dreams fall down
[00:44.070]Is anybody out there?
[00:45.690]
[00:46.760]It is breaking me down
[00:49.600]No more friends around...
[00:52.420]And my dreams fall down...
[00:55.460]Is anybody out there?
[00:57.420]Can anybody out there hear me?
[01:00.170]'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
[01:03.050]Can anybody out there see me?
[01:05.690]'Cause I can't seem to see myself...
[01:08.730]There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
[01:11.260]Can you save me from this hell?
[01:14.460]Can anybody out there feel me?
[01:16.980]'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
[01:19.610]Losing my way
[01:22.140]Keep losing my way...
[01:24.990]Keep losing my way...
[01:27.420]Can you help me find my way?
[01:31.050]Losing my way
[01:33.390]Keep losing my way
[01:36.180]Keep losing my way...
[01:38.710]Can you help me find my way?
[01:40.520]
[01:42.610]Now you gotta understand I was a family man
[01:45.300]I would have done anything for my own
[01:48.300]But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch
[01:50.960]So I ended up all alone
[01:53.930]I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
[01:56.680]See I thought I was living the life
[01:59.440]And the craziest thing is
[02:01.060]I'll probably never know the color
[02:02.970]of my daughter's eyes
[02:04.990]
[02:05.340]And it is breaking me down
[02:08.660]Watching the world spin round
[02:11.560]While me dreams fall down
[02:14.310]Is anybody out there?
[02:16.490]
[02:17.230]It is breaking me down
[02:19.950]No more friends around...
[02:22.780]And my dreams fall down...
[02:25.950]Is anybody out there?
[02:27.880]Can anybody out there hear me?
[02:30.680]'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
[02:33.610]Can anybody out there see me?
[02:36.210]'Cause I can't seem to see myself
[02:39.260]There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
[02:41.950]Can you save me from this hell?
[02:44.920]Can anybody out there feel me?
[02:47.430]'Cause I can't seem to feel myself.
[02:50.170]Losing my way
[02:52.650]Keep losing my way
[02:55.450]Keep losing my way
[02:57.970]Can you help find my way?
[03:01.300]Losing my way
[03:03.780]Keep losing my way
[03:06.770]Keep losing my way
[03:09.170]Can you help me find my way?
[03:11.020]
[03:14.190]Oh my god please forgive me （father hear my pray）
[03:18.840]'Cause I know I've done some wrong in this life
[03:24.470]If I could do it all again
[03:27.190]Have just one more chance
[03:30.210]To take all those wrongs and make them right
[03:35.210]
[03:35.890]Can anybody out there hear me?
[03:38.610]'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
[03:41.450]Can anybody out there see me?
[03:44.110]'Cause I can't seem to see myself
[03:47.150]There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
[03:49.870]Can you save me from this hell
[03:52.750]Can anybody out there feel me?
[03:55.370]'Cause I can't seem to feel myself.
[03:58.150]
[03:58.820]Can anybody out there hear me?
[04:01.310]'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
[04:04.240]Can anybody out there see me?
[04:06.750]'Cause I can't seem to see myself
[04:09.860]There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
[04:12.540]Can you save me from this hell
[04:15.490]Can anybody out there feel me?
[04:18.040]'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
[04:20.810]Losing my way
[04:23.120]Keep losing my way
[04:26.020]Keep losing my way
[04:28.470]Can you help me find my way?
