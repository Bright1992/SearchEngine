[00:05.410] Uhm m m m，yeah eh eh eh m，yi yeah.
[00:14.560] I stare at my reflection in the mirror
[00:21.760] Why am I doing this to myself
[00:29.220] Losing my mind on a tiny error
[00:35.740] I nearly left the real me on the shelf
[00:40.490] No, no, no, no
[00:42.940] Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars!
[00:50.220] Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing,
[00:54.700] It’s okay not to be okay
[00:57.340] Sometimes it’s hard to follow your heart
[01:04.360]Tears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising,
[01:08.310]Just be true to who you are!
[01:25.530] Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?
[01:32.900] I forgot what to do to fit the mould, yeah!
[01:39.390] The more I try the less it's working, yeah
[01:46.400] 'Cause everything inside me screams: no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:53.490] Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars!
[02:00.810] Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
[02:04.760] It’s okay not to be okay
[02:07.950] Sometimes it’s hard to follow your heart
[02:14.950] But tears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising,
[02:18.800]There's nothing wrong with who you are!
[02:21.270] Yes, no, egos, fake shows, like whoa!
[02:25.000] Just go, and leave me alone
[02:28.520] Real talk, real life, good love, goodnight,
[02:31.990]With a smile that's my home!
[02:41.700]That's my home, no...
[03:07.000] No, no, no, no, no…
[03:11.100] Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars!
[03:18.400] Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
[03:22.550] It’s okay not to be okay
[03:25.470] Sometimes it’s hard to follow your heart
[03:32.430]Tears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising,
[03:36.390] Just be true to who you are
[03:44.100] Yeah, Yeah….
