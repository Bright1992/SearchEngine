[01:28.27]I took a piss and dismiss it like 'fuck it' and I went and found somebody else.

[03:37.25]Things used to be; now they not.
[03:39.99]Anything but us is who we are.
[03:42.36]Disguising ourselves as secret lovers,
[03:44.40]We've become public enemies.
[03:46.78]We walk away like strangers in the street;
[03:49.80]Gone for eternity,
[03:51.65]We erased one another.
[03:53.32]So far from where we came,
[03:55.46]with so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing.
[03:59.42]Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E.
[04:03.85]Hatred and attitude tear us entirely.
