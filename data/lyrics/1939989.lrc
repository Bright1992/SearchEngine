[00:03.646]Royce  Da 5'9"]
[00:04.627]First  verse,uh
[00:04.658]I ’m  on ’til  I ’m  on  a  island
[00:07.606]My  life ’s  ridin ’on  the  Autobahn  on  autopilot
[00:09.675]Before  I  touch  dirt,I ’ll  kill  you  all  wit ’kindness
[00:12.669]I  kill  ya,my  natural  persona ’s  much  worse
[00:15.602]You ’ve  been  warned  if  you ’ve  been  born  or  if  you  conform
[00:17.676]Slap  up  a  cop  and  then  snatch ‘im  out  of  his  uniform
[00:20.625]Leave  him  wit ’his  socks,hard  bottoms  and  bloomers  on
[00:23.639]And  hang  him  by  his  balls  from  the  horn  of  a  unicorn
[00:26.629]Y ’all  niggas ’intellect  mad  slow,y ’all  fags  know
[00:29.602]Claimin ’you  bangin ’,you  flamin ’
[00:30.665]Bet  you  could  light  your  own  cigarette  witcha  asshole
[00:32.658]Me  and  Shady  deaded  the  past,so  that  basically  resurrected  my  cashflow
[00:37.635]I  might  rap  tight  as  the  snatch  of  a  fat  dyke
[00:39.699]Though  I  ain ’t  wrapped  tight
[00:41.646]My  blood  type ’s  the ’80s!
[00:43.623]My ’90s  was  like  the  Navy,you  was  like  the  Bradys
[00:45.677]You  still  fly  kites  daily!
[00:47.639]Eminem]
[00:47.660]Catch  me  in  my  Mercedes
[00:48.641]Bumpin ’“Ice,Ice  Baby,”screamin ’Shady ’til  I  die
[00:51.640]Like  a  half  a  pair  of  dice,life ’s  crazy
[00:53.638]So  I  live  it  to  the  fullest ’til  I ’m  Swayze
[00:55.666]And  you  only  live  it  once,so  I ’m  thinkin ’’bout  this  nice,nice  lady
[00:58.696]Wait,no,stop  me  now ‘fore  I  get  on  a  roll （Danish）
[01:01.635]Let  me  tell  you  what  this  pretty  little  dame ’s  name  is,’cause  she ’s  kinda  famous
[01:05.618]And  I  hope  that  I  don ’t  sound  too  heinous  when  I  say  this
[01:07.637]Nicki  Minaj,but  I  wanna  stick  my  penis  in  your  anus!
[01:10.651]You  morons  think  that  I ’m  a  genius
[01:12.623]Really  I  belong  inside  a  dang  insane  asylum,cleanin ’,try  them  trailer  parks
[01:14.687]Crazy,I  am  back,and  I  am  razor-sharp,baby
[01:18.607]And  that ’s  back  wit ’a  capital  B  wit ’an  exclamation  mark,maybe
[01:20.697]You  should  listen  when  I  flip  the  linguistics
[01:22.679]‘Cause  I ’m ‘onna  rip  this  mystical  slick  shit
[01:24.677]You  don ’t  wanna  become  another  victim  or  statistic  of  this  shit
[01:26.675]‘Cause  after  I  spit  the  bullets,I ’ma  treat  these  shell  casings  like  a  soccer  ball
[01:30.600]I ’ma  kick  the  ballistics!So  get  this  dick,I ’ma  live  this
[01:32.643]（Hook）
[01:32.658]Livin ’life  in  the  fast  lane
[01:33.695]Movin ’at  the  speed  of  life  and  I  can ’t  slow  down
[01:36.690]Only  got  a  gallon  in  the  gas  tank
[01:39.649]But  I ’m  almost  at  the  finish  line,so  I  can ’t  stop  now
[01:42.669]I  don ’t  really  know  where  I ’m  headed,just  enjoyin ’the  ride
[01:45.663]Just  gon ’roll ’til  I  drop  and  ride ’til  I  die
[01:48.627]I ’m  livin ’life  in  the  fast  lane （Pedal  to  the  metal）

[01:54.626]Royce  Da 5'9"]
[01:54.677]My  whole  goal  as  a  poet ’s  to  be  relaxed  in  orbit
[01:57.605]At  war  wit ’a  bottle,this  Captain  Morgan  attacks  my  organs
[01:59.682]My  slow  flow  is  euphoric,it ’s  like  I  rap  endorphins
[02:02.630]I  made  a  pact  with  the  Devil  that  says “I ’ll  let  you  take  me
[02:05.681]You  let  me  take  this  shovel,dig  up  the  corpes,Jack  Kevorkian ”
[02:08.655]Go ‘back  and  forth  in  more  beef  that  you  can  pack  a  fork  in
[02:11.634]I ’m  livin ’the  life  of  the  infinite  enemy  down
[02:13.627]My  tenement,too  many  now,to  send  my  serenity  powers
[02:14.674]Spin ‘em  around,enterin ’in  the  vicinity
[02:16.622]Eminem]
[02:16.637]Now,was  called  Eminem,but  he  threw  away  the  candy  and  ate  the  rapper
[02:19.656]Chewed  him  up （Pt!）and  spitted  him  out
[02:21.629]Girl,giddy-up,now  get,get  down
[02:22.625]He ’s  lookin ’around  this  club  and  it  looks  like  people  are  havin ’a  shit  fit  now
[02:25.635]Here,little  t-t-trailer  trash,take  a  look  who ’s  back  in  t-t-town
[02:27.653]Did  I  s-st-stutter,motherf-cker?F-ck  the  mall,he ’s  just
[02:30.615]A  whole  motherfuckin ’Walmart  d-d-down  every  time  he  comes  a-r-r-round
[02:33.607]And  he  came  to  the  club  tonight  wit ’5’9″to  hold  this  bitch  down
[02:35.691]Like  a  motherf-ckin ’chick  underwater,he  tryna  d-dr-drown
[02:38.657]Shawty,when  you  dance,you  got  me  captivated
[02:39.689]Just  by  the  way  that  you  keep  lickin ’them  dicks  like  lips,I ’m  agitated,aggravated
[02:43.629]To  the  point  you  don ’t  suck  my  dick,then  you ’re  gonna  get  decapitated
[02:46.634]Other  words,you  don ’t  fuckin ’give  me  head,then  I ’m  have  to  take  it
[02:49.632]And  then  after  takin ’that,I ’ma  catch  a  case,it ’s  gon ’be  fascinatin ’
[02:49.669]Royce]
[02:52.602]It ’s  gon ’say “The  whole  rap  game  passed  away ”on  top  of  the  affadavit
[02:55.612]Graduated  from  master  debater  slash  massive  masturbator
[02:56.684]To  Michael  Jackson ’activator （Woo!）
[02:59.633]Meanin ’I ’m  on  fire  off  the  top,might  wanna  back  up  the  data
[03:01.692]Runnin ’over  hip-hop  in  a  verbal  tractor-trailer
[03:03.698]Homey,this  sick,you  can  normally  ask  a  hater
[03:06.616]Don ’t  it  make  sense,these  shell  casings  is  just  like  a  bag  of  paper
[03:08.695]Drop  in  the  lap  of  a  tax  evader （Homie,they  spent）
[03:10.683]Now  make  that  ass  drop  like  a  sack  of  potatoes
[03:12.666]What,girl,I ’m  the  crack-a-lator
[03:14.608]Percolator  this  party,be  my  penis  ejaculator  later
[03:16.698]Tell  you  boyfriend  that  you  just  struck  paydirt
[03:19.637]You  rollin ’wit ’a  player,you  won ’t  be  exaggeratin ’when  you  sayin ’
