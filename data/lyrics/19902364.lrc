[00:10.110]I dive into frozen waves where the
[00:13.710]past comes back to life
[00:17.390]Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was
[00:21.210]worth it every time
[00:24.950]Hold still right before we crash 'cause
[00:28.260]we both know how this ends
[00:32.270]A clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass
[00:35.500]and I drown in you again
[00:39.740]'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
[00:47.550]Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
[00:55.190]If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
[01:02.400]If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
[01:42.710]If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
[01:49.040]If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
[02:05.340]Walk on through a red parade and
[02:07.910]refuse to make amends
[02:11.970]It cuts deep through our ground and
[02:14.730]makes us forget all common sense
[02:19.350]Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause
[02:22.880]we both know what we'll choose
[02:26.880]If you pull then I'll push too deep
[02:30.000]and I'll fall right back to you
[02:35.420]'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
[02:42.620]Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
[02:50.350]If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
[02:57.590]If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
[03:32.990]Why are you my clarity?
[03:40.100]Why are you my remedy?
[03:48.730]Why are you my clarity?
[03:55.770]Why are you my remedy?
[04:06.640]If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
[04:14.010]If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
