[00:02.28]You got me so wild
[00:05.13]How can I ever deny?
[00:07.90]You got me so high
[00:12.06]So high I cannot feel the fire
[00:16.25]And you keep telling me
[00:19.29]Telling me that you'll be sweet
[00:22.10]And you never wanna leave my side
[00:25.27]As long as I don't break these
[00:29.08]Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
[01:04.19]And they still feel all so wasted on myself
[02:04.38]You got me so wild
[02:08.22]How can I ever deny?
[02:11.46]You got me so high
[02:14.67]So high I cannot feel the fire
[02:18.09]And you keep telling me
[02:21.85]Telling me that you'll be sweet
[02:24.85]And you never wanna leave my side
[02:28.57]As long as I don't break these
[02:31.36]Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
[03:08.36]And they still feel all so wasted on myself
