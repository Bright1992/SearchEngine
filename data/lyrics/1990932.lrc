[00:28.21]Baby when you leave
[00:30.82]I hold nothing back
[00:34.32]Weapons up my sleeve
[00:37.84]Like I'm under attack
[00:41.53]So cover up your ears
[00:44.38]'Cause it only fuels the fire
[00:48.30]I'll be what you fear
[00:51.26]I'm the answer of your desire
[01:07.97]I touch the sky, your heart is
[01:37.39]If you hear me now why don't you recall?
[01:43.12]I was the one who cared after all
[01:49.94]I touch the sky
[01:52.27]Let the light in my face
[01:53.80]Pierce through my skin
[01:55.61]Gone with the wind
[01:57.21]I touch the sky
[01:58.29]Let it fade into grey
[02:00.66]Burst through the seams
[02:01.93]I'm on the wind
[02:04.07]I touch the sky
