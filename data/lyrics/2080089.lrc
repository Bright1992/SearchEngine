作曲 : Adams, Price
B Boy and B Girl, come on let's…
Da da da da da hey!
B Boy….dance!

B Boyz, and B Girlz, c'mon let's dance!
B Boyz, and B Girlz, c'mon let's dance!

Place that, taste that, chase rap ill
When I rock that I do bill
I've got skills, not run of the mill
Told you before I ain't never gonna chill
Blaze that, uh, we can raise that up
Sedate the rhyme, or pour it straight in the cup
Yo, drink it down, cause I'm wearin' the crown
All the little children now please gather around

Listen to me, now, while I'm splittin' this free
Not the kind of guy that you ever see like me
When I do it it's good, cause we bumpin' the hood
And records come out on the street and they go triple wood
Uh, the style's just too hot
Lovin' the rhythm the way and I make that pop
When it comes to rockin' freeze yo, I just don't stop
Right now you'll hear the record drop

B Boyz, and B Girlz, c'mon let's dance!
B Boyz, and B Girlz, c'mon let's dance!

Now, yo, I speak to the people
Give them the real, and not the evil
I won't deceive you, come in the flesh
Tap on the mike, give it a test
When it comes to rhymes, my mind never rests
You can say that I'm spiritually blessed
Yeah, every time that I'm at events
When I step to the mike, I get straight off my chest
There's no time left, hip hop's dyin'
Can't you see Mother Hip Hop's cryin'
Yeah, I'm tryin' to move to Zion
Spit rhymes off that do now without tryin'
When a record come out, you should be buyin'

Supernatural, that individual that gets lyrical
Put a crown on me, cause I am Imperial
I should have my face on front of a box of cereal
Freestyle crunchies for when you get the munchies
This is for the children, this if for the child
The way that I freak the style

Put a skirt on it, he'll watch me do work on it
Clean it off and then blow off the dirt on it
Like I said, search and destroy
This is dedicated to all the B Boyz

B Boyz, and B Girlz, c'mon let's dance!
B Boyz, and B Girlz, c'mon let's dance!
