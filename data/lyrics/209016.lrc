[00:14.23]It's getting dark
[00:17.80]Clouds stick around
[00:21.28]But you choose to run away from me and the clouds
[00:28.12]You are dry and calm
[00:31.57]I am getting drawn
[00:36.37]It's gonna rain somehow
[02:05.03][00:42.40]It's getting dark
[02:08.87][00:45.29]Clouds stick around
[02:13.50][00:49.37]Where have the sun the breeze the happiness gone
[02:19.48][00:55.73]You won't even stay
[02:22.90][00:58.88]With a coffee to go
[02:27.35][01:03.79]It's all out of my control
[02:33.51][01:09.87]We were the ones who fell deeply in love
[02:37.06][01:13.18]We were the ones who whispered in the dark
[02:40.45][01:16.59]We used to be the ones who didn't care about comes around
[02:47.30][01:23.61]We were the ones fear of being apart
[02:50.85][01:27.05]We were the ones who always hanging tough
[02:54.42][01:30.58]We're meant to be caught up in the rain
[03:00.95]It's getting dark
[03:04.39]Clouds stick around
[03:09.10]The raindrops took away your smile that used to be mine
[03:15.92]You are still around
[03:19.12]Waiting for the coffee to go
[03:23.55]I had my eyes closed
