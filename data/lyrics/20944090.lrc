[00:01.920]Take me to that old familiar place
[00:06.580]Take me to memories we won't erase
[00:11.140]Take me to all that we had
[00:15.740]Good and the bad
[00:18.080]I'll never forget you
[00:22.550]I'll never let you go
[00:26.820]I'll never forget you
[00:30.330]I'll always remember, I hope you know
[00:37.470]Let the record reflect the records we set
[00:39.640]Best foot forward with every step
[00:41.890]And let's push towards it, never regress
[00:44.170]And let's remember, if ever we get
[00:46.500]Down, the places that we came from 'round
[00:48.770]And all the good times on the bad side of town
[00:50.980]The upside of bad, flip it upside down
[00:53.250]Came from the bottom but we up high now
[00:55.530]Believe, and from this view we achieved
[00:57.930]We looked back at the rules we received
[01:00.150]And how we broke those, dismantled and rewrote those
[01:02.820]And the ghost still alive in the photos
[01:05.000]Sounds of the summer, day and go wise
[01:07.060]Cold wind blowin' through a city on fire
[01:09.320]Moments of the past, came here to find you
[01:11.720]Not to relive them, just to remind you
[01:15.160]Take to that old familiar place
[01:19.660]Take me to memories we won't erase
[01:24.250]Take me to all that we had
[01:28.800]Good and the bad
[01:31.360]I'll never forget you
[01:35.750]I'll never let you go
[01:40.040]I'll never forget you
[01:43.440]I'll always remember, I hope you know
[01:50.350]And let the evidence show, the future's so bright
[01:52.760]It's never been more, not like tonight
[01:55.010]We walk into the glow, right into the light
[01:57.270]The past all around us, the time of our life
[01:59.560]The first love kisses, the broke heart disses
[02:01.880]This is just like a first-class ticket
[02:03.720]Back, to the first written rap
[02:06.390]The crumbled-up paper and the pen with no cap
[02:08.680]The hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat
[02:10.960]The hookers on the corner and the kids sellin' crack
[02:13.280]The needles in the yard where we used to play catch
[02:15.590]Stories from the project we could never go at
[02:17.810]Or to, these are shades of my youth
[02:20.200]Trials of a child, everything truth
[02:22.440]Moments of the past, comin' back to find us
[02:25.110]Not to relive them, just to remind us
[02:28.390]Take to that old familiar place
[02:32.800]Take me to memories we won't erase
[02:37.350]Take me to all that we had
[02:41.930]Good and the bad
[02:44.380]I'll never forget you
[02:48.870]I'll never let you go
[02:53.100]I'll never forget you
[02:56.560]I'll always remember, I hope you know
[03:03.710]Everything cherished, remembered in my heart
[03:05.940]So you will never perish, you will never part
[03:08.150]I tell 'em all about you, drummin' in the park
[03:10.460]We put you in the ground, but I see you in the stars
[03:12.760]Go'n, take a bow, a round of applause
[03:14.980]The best that ever, always ready we are
[03:17.250]Love always shines, that's how I'll find you
[03:19.600]In case you forgot, I hope this reminds you
[03:23.240]Take to that old familiar place
[03:27.620]Take me to memories we won't erase
[03:32.180]Take me to all that we had
[03:36.880]Good and the bad
[03:39.080]I'll never forget you
[03:43.700]I'll never let you go
[03:47.970]I'll never forget you
[03:51.480]I'll always remember, I hope you know
[03:56.740]yeah
