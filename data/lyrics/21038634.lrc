[00:37.110]When he comes to me, I am ready
[00:39.980]Iˇll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
[00:43.950]Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
[00:47.310]Even after three times, he betrays me
[00:51.390]Iˇll bring him down, bring him down, down
[00:58.610]A king with no crown, king with no crown
[01:06.800]Iˇm just a Holy Fool, oh baby heˇs so cruel
[01:09.610]But Iˇm still in love with Judas, baby

[01:42.979]I couldnˇt love a man so purely
[01:46.210]Even darkness forgave his crooked way
[01:49.650]Iˇve learned our love is like a brick you can
[01:53.750]Build a house or sink a dead body

[02:37.580]I'm in love with Judas
[02:58.110]In the most Biblical sense,
[02:58.950]I am beyond repentance
[03:00.310]Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind
[03:03.420]But in the cultural sense
[03:05.930]I just speak in future tense
[03:07.830]Judas kiss me if offenced,
[03:09.460]Or wear an ear condom next time
[03:11.800]I wanna love you,
[03:14.800]But somethingˇs pulling me away from you
[03:19.360]Jesus is my virtue,
[03:22.140]Judas is the demon I cling to
[03:27.200]I cling to
[03:30.460]Iˇm just a Holy Fool, oh baby heˇs so cruel
[03:33.670]But Iˇm still in love with Judas, baby
[03:36.940]Iˇm just a Holy Fool, oh baby heˇs so cruel
[03:40.910]But Iˇm still in love with Judas, baby
[03:46.950]I'm in love with Judas
[03:55.080]I'm in love with Judas
[03:59.160]Judas! Judaas Judas! Judaas
[04:03.900]Judas! Judaas Judas! GAGA
