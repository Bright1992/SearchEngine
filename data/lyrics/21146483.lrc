[00:10.36]
[00:42.13]Can't get the stink off
[00:44.99]He's been hanging round for days
[00:49.56]Comes like a comet
[00:52.51]Suckered you but not your friends
[00:57.43]One day he'll get to you
[01:00.01]And teach you how to be a holy cow
[01:05.22]You do it to yourself, you do
[01:09.09]And that's what really hurts
[01:10.64]Is that you do it to yourself
[01:12.56]Just you and no one else
[01:15.79]You do it to yourself
[01:20.72]You do it to yourself
[01:36.47]Don't get my sympathy
[01:39.34]Hanging out the 15th floor
[01:44.00]You've changed the locks three times
[01:46.77]He still comes reeling through the door
[01:51.55]One day I'll get you
[01:59.49]You do it to yourself, you do
[02:03.23]And that's what really hurts
[02:04.98]Is that you do it to yourself
[02:06.76]Just you, you and no one else
[02:09.98]You do it to yourself
[02:15.02]You do it to yourself
[02:20.55]
[03:42.93]You do it to yourself, you do
[03:46.69]And that's what really hurts
[03:48.46]Is that you do it to yourself
[03:50.16]Just you, you and no one else
[03:53.62]You do it to yourself
[03:58.49]You do it to yourself.. yourself.. yourself..
