[00:02.29]I don't wanna see you go
[00:04.10]I want somebody to love me
[00:10.16]Why'd it take so long to know
[00:12.19]I want somebody to love me
[00:16.53]I want somebody to be nice
[00:20.29]See the boy I once was in my eyes
[00:24.45]Nobody's gonna save my life
[00:33.90]We are wicked men
[00:36.49]Looking for buckles to loosen
[00:41.92]By the count of 10
[00:44.64]I wanna see somebody human
[00:50.23]And I lost what it was
[00:52.14]In the teenage dust
[00:54.23]Of a downtown Romeo
[00:58.38]In a couple of weeks
[01:00.42]You can tell all the freaks
[01:02.43]How you carried my body home
[01:07.18]But tonight
[01:09.25]I crossed the line
[01:11.23]Dear Mr. Lonely
[01:13.19]How much could you know me
[01:15.38]I could find lessons in light
[01:19.49]But once you've earned it
[01:21.29]You've already burned it
[01:23.33]I don't wanna see you go
[01:25.36]I need somebody to love me (Need somebody oh)
[01:31.50]Why'd it take so long to know
[01:33.54]I need somebody to love me (Need somebody oh)
[01:37.95]I want somebody to be nice
[01:41.69]See the boy I once was in my eyes
[01:46.05]Nobody's gonna save my life
[01:51.51]Got my ticket man and
[01:53.89]I'm looking
[01:59.37]I know we pretend
[02:01.67]But one of these days
[02:03.01]We're gonna lose it
[02:07.63]And I once left town
[02:09.48]When the leaves turned brown
[02:11.50]With a couple of souvenirs
[02:15.88]She was in my car
[02:17.76]When we hit that wall
[02:20.01]Yeah it could've move me to tears
[02:24.48]But tonight
[02:26.49]I crossed the line
[02:28.53]I used to know her
[02:30.54]When my house was sober
[02:32.60]I could find lessons in light
[02:37.77]Over and over, is it really over
[02:38.66]
[02:40.70]I don't wanna see you go
[02:42.71]I need somebody to love me (Need somebody oh)
[02:48.80]Why'd it take so long to know
[02:50.94]I need somebody to love me (Need somebody oh)
[02:55.22]I want somebody to be nice
[02:59.04]See the boy I once was in my eyes
[03:03.19]Nobody's gonna save my life
[03:21.37]But tonight
[03:23.52]I crossed the line
[03:25.47]I used to know her
[03:27.46]When my house was sober
[03:29.44]I could find lessons in light
[03:33.49]Over and over, is it really over
[03:35.56]
[03:37.57]I don't wanna see you go
[03:39.63]I want somebody to love me (Need somebody oh)
[03:45.75]Why'd it take so long to know
[03:47.81]I want somebody to love me (Need somebody oh)
[03:52.15]I want somebody to be nice
[03:55.96]See the boy I once was in my eyes
[04:00.14]Nobody's gonna save my life
