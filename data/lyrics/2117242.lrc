[00:16.270]I've been walking
[00:17.360]In the same way as I did
[00:24.410]Missing out
[00:25.430]The cracks in the pavement
[00:27.920]And tutting my heel
[00:29.650]And strutting my feet
[00:31.990]Is there anything
[00:33.300]I can do for you dear?
[00:35.950]Is there anyone I could call?
[00:40.110]No and thank you, please Madam
[00:43.760]I ain't lost, just wandering
[00:49.930]Round my hometown
[00:52.910]Memories are fresh
[00:57.620]Round my hometown
[01:00.700]Ooh, the people I've met
[01:05.420]Are the wonders of my world
[01:09.320]Are the wonders of my world
[01:13.270]Are the wonders of this world
[01:17.460]Are the wonders of my world
[01:22.100]I like it in the city
[01:23.680]When the air
[01:25.990]Is so thick and opaque
[01:29.200]I love to see everybody
[01:32.509]In short skirts
[01:33.700]Shorts and shades
[01:36.970]I like it in the city
[01:38.800]When two worlds collide
[01:44.539]You get the people
[01:45.640]And the government
[01:47.610]Everybody taking
[01:50.120]Different sides
[01:52.900]Shows that
[01:53.560]We ain't gonna stand shit
[01:55.300]Shows
[01:55.640]That we are united
[01:57.150]Shows
[01:57.630]That we ain't gonna take it
[02:00.490]Shows
[02:00.930]That we ain't gonna stand shit
[02:02.940]Shows that we are united
[02:07.620]Round my hometown
[02:10.530]Memories are fresh
[02:15.790]Round my hometown
[02:18.480]Ooh the people I've met
[02:54.630]Are the wonders of my world
[02:58.280]Are the wonders of my world
[03:02.240]Are the wonders of this world
[03:06.660]Are the wonders of my world~~
