[00:07.000]I've been walking in the same way as I did
[00:14.800]Missing out the cracks in the pavement
[00:18.120]And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
[00:21.980]“Is there anything I can do for you dear?
[00:25.780]Is there anyone I could call?”
[00:29.840]“No and thank you' please Madam.
[00:33.040]I ain't lost' just wandering”
[00:37.240]
[00:39.620]Round my hometown
[00:41.020]Memories are fresh
[00:46.610]Round my hometown
[00:49.790]Ooh the people I've met
[00:54.650]Are the wonders of my world
[00:58.590]Are the wonders of my world
[01:02.470]Are the wonders of this world
[01:06.870]Are the wonders of my world
[01:24.420]I like it in the city
[01:27.550]when the air is so thick and opaque
[01:32.760]I love to see everybody
[01:35.910]in short skirts' shorts and shades
[01:40.370]I like it in the city when two worlds collide
[01:47.430]You get the people and the government
[01:50.380]Everybody taking different sides
[01:55.440]Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
[01:58.340]Shows that we are united
[01:59.890]Shows that we ain't gonna take it
[02:02.930]Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
[02:05.330]Shows that we are united
[02:10.090]Round my hometown
[02:17.700]Round my hometown
[02:32.640]Round my hometown
[02:35.440]Memories are fresh
[02:40.090]Round my hometown
[02:44.300]Ooh the people I've met
[02:48.010]Are the wonders of my world
[02:51.360]Are the wonders of my world
[02:55.020]Are the wonders of this world
[02:59.120]Are the wonders of my world....
