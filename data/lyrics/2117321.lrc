[00:14.78]Waking up I see that everything is ok
[00:18.24]The first time in my life and now it's so great
[00:21.76]Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed
[00:25.56]I think about the little things that make life great
[00:30.51]I wouldn't change a thing about it
[00:36.33]This is the best feeling
[00:43.92]This innocence is brilliant, I hope that it will stay
[00:50.86]This moment is perfect, please don't go away, I need you now
[01:03.96]And I'll hold on to it, don't you let it pass you by
[01:12.29]It's the state of bliss you think you're dreaming
[01:15.44]It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
[01:18.84]It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry
[01:26.26]It's the state of bliss you think you're dreaming
[01:29.49]It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
[01:32.93]It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry
[01:40.44]It's so beautiful it makes you want to cry
[01:43.87]This innocence is brilliant, I hope that it will stay
[01:50.69]This moment is perfect, please don't go away, I need you now
[02:03.64]And I'll hold on to it, don't you let it pass you by
