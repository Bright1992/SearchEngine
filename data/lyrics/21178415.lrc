[01:09.000]There's a place in your heart
[01:12.000]And I know that it is love
[01:15.000]And this place could be much
[01:17.000]Brighter than tomorrow
[01:21.000]And if you really try
[01:23.000]You'll find there's no need to cry
[01:27.000]In this place you'll feel
[01:29.000]There's no hurt or sorrow
[01:33.000]There are ways to get there
[01:36.000]If you care enough for the living
[01:39.000]Make a little space
[01:41.000]Make a better place ...

[02:25.000]In this bliss we cannot feel
[02:28.000]Fear od dread

[03:13.000]Will reveal a joyful face
[03:16.000]And the world we once believed in
[03:18.000]Will shine again in grace
[03:22.000]Then why do we keep strangling life
[03:25.000]Wound this earth, crucify its soul
[03:28.000]Though it's plain to see
[03:29.000]This world is heavenly

[03:49.500]Together we cry happy tears
[03:52.500]See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
