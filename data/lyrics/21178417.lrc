[00:59.499]I gave her money
[01:01.499]I gave her time
[01:03.499]I gave her everything
[01:05.499]Inside one heart could find
[01:08.499]I gave her passion
[01:10.499]My very soul
[01:13.499]I gave her promises
[01:15.499]And secrets so untold
[01:17.499]And she promised me forever
[01:19.499]And a day we'd live as one
[01:22.499]We made our vows We'd live a life anew
[01:26.499]And she promised me in secret
[01:28.499]That she'd love me for all the time
[01:31.499]It's a promise so untrue
[01:33.499]Tell me what will I do ?
[01:35.499]And it doesn't seem to matter
[01:37.499]And it doesn't seem right
[01:40.499]'Cause the will has brought No fortune
[01:42.499]Still I cry alone at night
[01:44.499]Don't you judge of my composure
[01:47.499]'Cause I'm lying to myself
[01:49.499]And the reason why she left me
[01:51.499]Did she find someone else ?
[01:53.499]（Who is it ?）
[01:56.499]It is a friend of mine
[01:58.499]（Who is it ?）
[02:00.499]Is it my brother ?
[02:03.499]（Who is it ?）
[02:05.499]Somebody hurt my soul
[02:07.499]（Who is it ?）
[02:10.500]I can't take this stuff no more
[02:13.500]I am the damned
[02:15.500]I am the dead
[02:18.500]I am the agony inside
[02:20.500]The dying head
[02:22.500]This is injustice
[02:25.500]Woe unto thee
[02:27.500]I pray this punishment
[02:29.500]Would have mercy on me
[02:31.500]And she promised me forever
[02:33.500]That we'd live our life as one
[02:36.500]We made our vows
[02:37.500]We'd live a love so true
[02:41.500]It seems that she has left me
[02:42.500]For such reasons unexplained
[02:45.500]I need to find the truth
[02:47.500]But see what will I do ?
[02:49.500]And it doesn't seem to matter
[02:52.500]And it doesn't seem right
[02:54.500]'Cause the will has brought No fortune
[02:56.500]Still I cry alone at night
[02:59.500]Don't you judge of my composure
[03:01.500]'Cause I'm bothered everyday
[03:03.500]And she didn't leave a letter
[03:06.500]She just up and ran away
[03:08.500]（Who is it ?）
