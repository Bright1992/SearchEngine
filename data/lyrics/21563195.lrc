[00:32.75]Feel so good being bad (Oh oh oh oh oh)
[00:36.48]Cause no way I'm turning back (Oh oh oh oh oh)
[00:40.39]And now the pain is my pleasure
[00:42.22]Cause nothing could measure (Oh oh oh)
[00:45.00]
[00:47.69]Love is great, love is fine (Oh oh oh oh oh)
[00:51.37]Out the box, out the line (Oh oh oh oh oh)
[00:55.20]The affliction of the feeling

[01:01.88]
[01:02.15]Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
[01:05.74]Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
[01:09.48]Sticks and stones may break my bones
[01:12.64]But chains and whips excite me
[01:17.03]
[01:17.30]Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
[01:20.77]Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it

[02:48.49]It's exactly what I've been yearning for, give it to me strong
[02:55.85]And meet me in my boudoir with my body suit on-on-on
[03:00.90]I like it, like it
[03:01.88]
[03:02.09]Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
[03:05.75]Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
[03:09.55]Sticks and stones may break my bones
[03:12.64]But chains and whips excite me
