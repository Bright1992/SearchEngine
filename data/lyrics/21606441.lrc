[04:41.96][03:12.56][01:22.71][00:25.45]Breathe, breathe... breathe, breathe (throughout song)
[05:37.33][03:40.61][02:45.92][00:56.13]a silent heart ticking under the ground.
[05:44.03][03:47.55][02:52.62][01:02.96]taking the weight from which has yet to be found.
[05:50.46][03:53.90][02:59.61][01:09.70]if you can hear me now, why dont you recall?
[05:57.50][04:01.18][03:06.31][01:15.82]i was the one who cared after all.
