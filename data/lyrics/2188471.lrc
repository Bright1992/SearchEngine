[00:00.899]If I were a boy even just for a day
[00:12.300]I'd roll out of bed in the morning
[00:15.440]And throw on what I wanted
[00:18.780]And go drink beer with the guys
[00:27.260]And chase after girls
[00:33.308]I'd kick it with who I wanted
[00:37.169]And I'd never get confronted for it
[00:40.719]'Cause they stick up for me
[00:44.199]If I were a boy
[00:49.990]I think I could understand
[00:55.990]How it feels to love a girl
[00:58.669]I swear I'd be a better man
[01:05.330]I'd listen to her
[01:10.330]'Cause I know how it hurts
[01:15.740]When you lose the one you wanted
[01:20.279]'Cause he's taking you for granted
[01:22.449]And everything you had got destroyed
[01:27.369]If I were a boy
[01:31.899]I would turn off my phone
[01:38.619]Tell everyone it's broken
[01:41.610]So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
[01:48.199]I'd put myself first
[01:53.210]And make the rules as I go
[01:59.559]'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
[02:02.619]Waiting for me to come home, to come home
[02:09.610]If I were a boy
[02:14.340]I think I could understand
[02:20.780]How it feels to love a girl
[02:24.210]I swear I'd be a better man
[02:30.340]I'd listen to her
[02:35.710]'Cause I know how it hurts
[02:42.700]When you lose the one you wanted
[02:45.290]'Cause he's taking you for granted
[02:48.200]And everything you had got destroyed
[02:54.640]It's a little too late for you to come back
[02:59.470]Say it's just a mistake
[03:02.210]Think I'd forgive you like that
[03:04.860]If you thought I would wait for you
[03:08.810]You thought wrong
[03:14.550]But you're just a boy
[03:19.810]You don't understand
[03:22.240]And you don't understand, oh
[03:26.370]How it feels to love a girl
[03:28.800]Someday you wish you were a better man
[03:36.310]You don't listen to her
[03:41.500]You don't care how it hurts
[03:46.240]Until you lose the one you wanted
[03:50.560]'Cause you're taking her for granted
[03:53.180]And everything you had got destroyed
[03:59.360]But you're just a boy
[04:05.300]
