[00:04.310]This was never the way I planned
[00:08.390]Not my intention
[00:11.630]I got so brave, drink in hand
[00:15.830]Lost my discretion
[00:19.070]It's not what, I'm used to
[00:22.780]Just wanna try you on
[00:26.810]I'm curious for you
[00:30.560]Caught my attention
[00:34.010]I kissed a girl and I liked it
[00:37.590]The taste of her cherry chapstick
[00:41.040]I kissed a girl just to try it
[00:44.910]I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
[00:48.570]It felt so wrong
[00:50.780]It felt so right
[00:52.400]Don't mean I'm in love tonight
[00:56.010]I kissed a girl and I liked it
[01:00.750]I liked it
[01:07.080]No, I don't even know your name
[01:11.210]It doesn't matter
[01:13.840]Your my experimental game
[01:18.560]Just human nature
[01:21.950]It's not what, good girls do
[01:25.590]Not how they should behave
[01:29.450]My head gets so confused
[01:33.320]Hard to obey
[01:36.860]I kissed a girl and I liked it
[01:40.350]The taste of her cherry chapstick
[01:44.040]I kissed a girl just to try it
[01:47.610]I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
[01:51.010]It felt so wrong
[01:53.430]It felt so right
[01:55.180]Don't mean I'm in love tonight
[01:58.800]I kissed a girl and I liked it
[02:04.540]I liked it
[02:06.530]Us girls we are so magical
[02:09.810]Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
[02:13.570]Hard to resist so touchable
[02:17.180]Too good to deny it
[02:20.990]Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
[02:28.510]I kissed a girl and I liked it
[02:32.080]The taste of her cherry chapstick
[02:35.710]I kissed a girl just to try it
[02:39.620]I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
[02:43.120]It felt so wrong
[02:44.900]It felt so right
[02:46.890]Don't mean I'm in love tonight
[02:50.490]I kissed a girl and I liked it
[02:56.250]I liked it
