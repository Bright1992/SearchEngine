[00:04.50]You think I'm pretty
[00:06.13]Without any makeup on
[00:08.42]You think I'm funny
[00:10.07]When I tell the punchline wrong
[00:12.52]I know you get me
[00:14.04]So I let my walls come down, down
[00:20.57]Before you met me
[00:22.30]I was a wreck
[00:23.50]but things were kinda heavy
[00:25.95]You brought me to life
[00:27.50]Now every February
[00:30.13]You'll be my Valentine Valentine
[00:35.45]Let's go all the way tonight
[00:39.53]No regrets, just love
[00:43.21]We can dance, until we die
[00:47.55]You and I, will be young forever
[00:52.35]You make me
[00:54.40]feel like I'm living a teenage dream
[00:58.50]The way you turn me on
[01:00.17]I can't sleep
[01:02.49]Let's run away and
[01:03.74]Don't ever look back,
[01:05.59]Don't ever look back
[01:08.21]My heart stops
[01:10.67]When you look at me
[01:12.12]Just one touch
