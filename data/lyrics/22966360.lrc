[00:26.06]Your arms around me come undone
[00:32.70]makes my heart beat like a drum

[01:42.93]Your cheek is softly by the sun
[01:49.32]makes my heart beat like a drum
[01:55.97]I know it hurts you
[01:57.56]I know it burns you
[01:59.21]Hot and cold in a lonely hotel room
[02:02.62]Look into me, tell me why you're crying

[02:08.52]
[02:09.68]Cause you always want what you're running from
