[00:02.550]I’m about to lose my mind
[00:05.000]you’ve been gone for so long
[00:06.500]I’m running out of time
[00:10.070]I need a doctor,call me a doctor
[00:16.250]I need a doctor, doctor
[00:20.300]to bring me back to life
[00:29.740]I told the World one day I would pay it back
[00:32.910]say it on tape, and lay it, record it
[00:35.740]so that one day I could play it back
[00:36.980]but I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m saying that
[00:40.300]ya’ll starting to creep in, everyday it’s just so grey and black
[00:42.820]hope, I just need a ray of that
[00:44.970]cause no one see’s my vision when I play it for ‘em
[00:47.470]they just say it’s wack
[00:48.550]they don’t know what dope is
[00:49.820]and I don’t know if I was awake or asleep
[00:51.380]when I wrote this,
[00:52.170]all I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
[00:54.660]you picked me up, breeding life in me
[00:57.100]I owe my life to you
[00:58.120]before the life of me, I don’t see why you don’t see like I do
[01:01.200]but it just dawned on me you lost a son
[01:03.390]Demon's fighting you, it’s dark.
[01:04.870]let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
[01:07.380]I don’t think you realize what you mean to me
[01:09.480]not the slightest clue
[01:10.550]cause me and you were like a crew
[01:11.820]I was like your sidekick
[01:13.420]you gone either wanna fight me when I get off this fucking mic
[01:16.270]or you go hug me
[01:17.440]but I’m not an option, there‘s nothing else I can do cause…
[01:20.640]I’m about to lose my mind
[01:23.990]you’ve been gone for so long

[01:36.170]I need a doctor, doctor
[01:40.940]to bring me back to life
[01:45.900]It hurts when I see you struggle
[01:46.300]you come to me with ideas
[01:47.479]you say there just pieces so I’m puzzled
[01:49.789]cause the shit I hear is crazy
[01:51.110]but your either getting lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
[01:54.900]seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
[01:56.320]can’t make a decision you keep questioning yourself
[01:58.960]second guessing and it’s almost like your begging for my help
[02:02.900]like I’m your leader
[02:03.790]your supposed to fucking be my mentor
[02:05.480]I can endure no more,
[02:06.950]I demand you remember who you are
[02:08.880]it was YOU, who believed in me
[02:10.669]when everyone was telling you don’t sign me
[02:12.550]everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
[02:14.520]you risked your career for me
[02:16.510]I know it as well as you

[02:20.400]Dre, I’m crying in this booth
[02:21.560]you saved my life, now maybe it’s my turn to save yours
[02:24.250]but I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
[02:27.150]but I ain’t giving up faith and you ain’t giving up on me
[02:29.990]get up Dre, I’m dying, I need you, come back for f-ck’s sake
