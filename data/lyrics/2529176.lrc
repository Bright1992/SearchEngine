[00:05.10]Mr. Worldwide
[00:07.78]From Miami, Morocco

[00:13.69]Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
[00:21.08]Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop

[00:31.05]When the sun goes down, down, down, down
[00:34.30]Boy you're afraid of the dark, dark
[00:38.47]And when the lights go out, out, out, out
[00:41.90]Tell me do you know where to start, start
[00:45.98]And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
[00:49.53]That is when I feel apart, apart
[00:53.45]And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound
[00:56.50]Well the sound is the key of my heart, heart
[01:00.82]We run, yes we run the night, night
[01:12.18]We run, yes we run the night,

[01:40.49]Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
[01:43.07]From the bottom of the map, Miami
[01:44.96]To the land down under, Australia
[01:46.92]You feel my draft, see my vision and hear my hunger
[01:50.63]As my money gets older, girls get younger
[01:54.42]They sell their soul but the devil knows I have no number
[01:57.46]Come on baby, push on baby, go go baby
[02:00.26]Oh oh baby, no no baby, yeah yeah baby
[02:02.83]Now jiggle it baby, let me tickle it baby
[02:04.84]I know I'm lost, it's gonna be hard to save me
[02:06.85]I'm sorry that how they can't erase me
[02:09.14]You heard me right, we run the night
[02:11.39]Now fuck you pay me
[02:12.66]We run, yes we run the night, night
[02:23.93]We run, yes we run the night,
[02:28.13]We, we, we run, we, we, we run
[02:31.52]We run, yes we run the night, the night
[02:37.21]Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
[02:44.68]Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
[02:52.27]Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
[02:54.65]Feeling like a rush, rush, rush
[02:57.48]Pushing passed me, all over my skin, skin
[03:02.15]I can't get enough ‘nough ‘nough
[03:04.97]'Cause the beat keeps pulling me in
[03:09.73]Taking me so high up, up, up
[03:13.08]A place that I've never been, ahhhh
[03:17.37]Party, party all night, night, night,
[03:20.13]Sleep all day then do it again.
[03:24.42]We run, yes we run the night, night night
[03:30.15]Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
[03:32.02]We run, yes we run the night,
[03:36.20]We, we, we run, we, we, we run
[03:39.55]We run, yes we run the night, the night
[03:45.16]Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
