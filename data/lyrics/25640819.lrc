[00:16.76]These walls ache so silently
[00:23.32]
[00:25.06]In the dance of endless night
[00:30.31]
[00:32.87]While I’m playing make-believe
[00:39.67]
[00:41.29]You and I are still entwined
[00:45.91]
[00:48.84]Oh but all I have are dreams
[00:52.09]
[00:53.28]Only meant for me
[00:55.48]
[00:57.23]Hard to try and get to sleep
[01:02.41]
[01:05.15]Sometimes
[01:07.09]
[01:13.02]I miss kissing you goodnight
[01:22.29]
[01:37.55]Your eyes bright as crystal moons
[01:44.28]
[01:45.53]Lit the velvet skies above
[01:50.78]
[01:53.83]I said goodnight to you
[02:00.51]
[02:01.63]Once upon a time in love
[02:07.06]
[02:09.43]Oh but I had other dreams
[02:12.55]
[02:13.73]Only meant for me
[02:16.67]
[02:17.67]So I went and set you free
[02:22.79]
[02:25.78]But sometimes
[02:27.96]
[02:33.56]I miss kissing you goodnight
[02:43.74]
[02:50.04]Goodnight
[02:51.73]
[03:03.03]End
