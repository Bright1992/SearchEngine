[00:04.04]You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
[00:10.23]And with a word all my love came rushing out
[00:16.36]
[00:17.86]And every whisper; it's the worst, emptied out by a single word
[00:25.80]
[00:26.67]There is a hollow in me now
[00:29.26]
[00:33.32]So I'll put faith in something I know
[00:36.63]
[00:37.44]I'm living on such sweet nothing
[00:40.88]But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
[00:44.13]
[00:44.70]I'm living on such sweet nothing
[00:47.44]
[00:48.13]And it's hard to learn
[00:50.13]And it's hard to love
[00:51.95]When you're giving me such sweet nothing
[00:54.76]
[00:55.57]Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
[00:58.63]
[00:59.57]You're giving me such sweet nothing
[01:02.52]
[01:19.04]It isn't easy for me to let it go
[01:23.48]
[01:25.17]Cause, I've swallowed every single word
[01:30.85]
[01:32.86]And, every whisper, every sigh
[01:36.55]
[01:37.80]Eats away at this heart of mine
[01:40.48]
[01:41.36]And there is a hollow in me now
[01:44.30]
[01:48.30]So I'll put faith in something I know
[01:51.35]
[01:52.42]I'm living on such sweet nothing
[01:54.86]
[01:55.67]But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
[01:58.98]
[01:59.61]I'm living on such sweet nothing
[02:02.23]
[02:03.17]And it's hard to learn
[02:05.11]And it's hard to love
[02:06.48]
[02:07.17]When you're giving me such sweet nothing
[02:09.73]
[02:10.42]Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
[02:13.54]
[02:14.61]You're giving me such sweet nothing
[02:17.76]
[02:33.61]And it's not enough
[02:34.61]
[02:36.30]To tell me that you care
[02:38.49]
[02:39.99]When we both know the words are empty air
[02:46.12]
[02:47.24]You give me nothing
[02:48.43]
[02:51.80]Uoooh
[02:52.43]Uoooh
[02:53.49]Uoooh
[02:54.68]Nothing
[02:55.32]
[03:12.38]Uoooh
[03:13.82]Uoooh
[03:15.76]Uoooh
[03:16.88]Sweet nothing
[03:17.88]
[03:19.51]Uoooh
[03:20.82]Uoooh
[03:22.32]Uoooh
[03:23.44]
[03:24.07]Sweet nothing
