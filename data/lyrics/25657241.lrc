[00:03.899]If you ever leave me' baby
[00:10.507]Leave some morphine at my door
[00:16.418]Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
[00:23.589]To realize what we used to have
[00:25.897]We don't have it anymore
[00:29.598]There's no religion that could save me
[00:35.439]No matter how long my knees are on the floor
[00:40.539]（Ohh）
[00:41.919]So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
[00:48.590]To keep you by my side
[00:50.529]And keep from walking out the door
[00:54.339]'Cause there'll be no sunlight
[00:58.390]If I lose you' baby
[01:00.819]There'll be no clear skies
[01:04.290]If I lose you' baby
[01:07.359]Just like the clouds' my eyes will do the same
[01:12.569]If you walk away
[01:15.709]Every day it'll rain' rain' rain
[01:36.519]I'll never be your mother's favorite
[01:43.900]Your daddy can't even look me in the eye （Ooh）
[01:50.990]If I was in their shoes I'd be doinG the same thing
[01:55.490]Saying' "There goes my little girl
[01:57.919]Walking with that troublesome guy"
[02:01.339]But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
[02:07.348]Ooh but little darling' watch me change their minds
[02:14.970]Yeah for you I'll try' I'll try' I'll try
[02:19.877]I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
[02:23.966]If that'll make it right
[02:30.270]'Cause there'll be no sunlight
[02:33.197]If I lose you' baby
[02:37.389]There'll be no clear skies
[02:39.237]If I lose you' baby
[02:42.327]And just like the clouds' my eyes will do the same
[02:48.988]If you walk away
[02:51.387]Every day it'll rain' rain' rain
[03:10.370]Oh' don't you say （don't you say）

[03:20.387]Goodbye （goodbye）
[03:24.280]I'd pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
