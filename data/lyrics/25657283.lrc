[00:07.280]I know you're somewhere out there

[00:16.200]I want you back

[00:29.200]You're all I have
[00:34.190]At night when the stars light up my room
[00:40.780]I sit by myself
[00:44.510]Talking to the Moon
[00:51.400]Try to get to You
[00:58.830]In hopes you're on the other side
[01:02.530]Talking to me too
[01:04.610]Or am I a fool
