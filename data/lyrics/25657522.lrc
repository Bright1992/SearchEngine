[00:26.97]Remember all the things we wanted
[00:30.14]Now all our memories, they're haunted
[00:33.39]We were always meant to say goodbye
[00:40.02]Even with our fists held higher
[00:43.08]It never would've worked out right
[00:46.39]We were never meant for do or die
[00:49.20]
[00:53.14]I didn't want us to burn out
[00:57.99]I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop
[01:06.02]
[01:06.64]I want you to know that it doesn't matter
[01:13.20]Where we take this road someone's gotta go
[01:19.43]And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
[01:25.99]But I want you to move on so I'm already gone
[01:32.08]Looking at you makes it harder
[01:34.96]But I know that you'll find another
[01:38.15]That doesn't always make you want to cry
[01:44.83]Started with a perfect kiss then
[01:47.98]We could feel the poison set in
[01:51.30]Perfect couldn't keep this love alive
[01:58.48]You know that I love you so
[02:02.86]I love you enough to let you go
[02:10.92]
[02:11.48]I want you to know that it doesn't matter
[02:18.10]Where we take this road someone's gotta go
[02:24.29]And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
[02:30.85]But I want you to move on so I'm already gone
[02:37.35]I'm already gone, already gone
[02:43.66]You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
[02:50.36]I'm already gone, already gone
[02:56.84]There's no moving on so I'm already gone
[03:03.65]Already gone, already gone, already gone
[03:14.22]
[03:17.03]Already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah
[03:28.70]Remember all the things we wanted
[03:31.77]Now all our memories, they're haunted
[03:35.02]We were always meant to say goodbye
[03:42.33]I want you to know that it doesn't matter
[03:48.80]Where we take this road someone's gotta go
[03:55.09]And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
[04:01.65]But I want you to move on so I'm already gone
[04:08.15]I'm already gone, already gone
[04:14.42]You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
[04:21.11]I'm already gone, already gone
[04:27.55]There's no moving on so I'm already gone
[04:33.15]
