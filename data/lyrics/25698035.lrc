[00:08.73]Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
[00:12.94]And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
[00:18.37]Nothin' seems to fit
[00:20.69]Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'
[00:26.13]
[00:26.73]So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
[00:32.36]And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
[00:37.69]Sleepin' on the job
[00:39.90]Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'
[00:45.28]
[00:45.97]But there's one thing I know
[00:51.05]The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me
[00:57.38]It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
[01:04.69]
[01:08.38]Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
[01:12.50]But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
[01:17.77]Cryin's not for me
[01:20.03]'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
[01:25.54]Because I'm free
[01:30.11]Nothin's worryin' me
[01:36.46]
[01:42.01]It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
[01:49.10]
[01:52.10]Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
[01:56.26]But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
[02:01.47]Cryin's not for me
[02:03.63]'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
[02:09.51]Because I'm free
[02:13.58]Nothin's worryin' me
[02:17.76]Nothin's worryin' me
[02:24.59]
