[00:09.110]When you're down and troubled
[00:14.610]And you need some loving care
[00:19.910]And nothing, nothing is going right
[00:30.350]Close your eyes and think of me
[00:35.310]And soon I will be there
[00:40.710]To brighten up even your darkest night
[00:47.580]
[00:50.010]You just call out my name
[00:55.320]And you know wherever I am
[01:00.360]I'll come running to see you again
[01:08.790]
[01:12.300]Winter, spring, summer or fall
[01:17.100]All you have to do is call
[01:21.900]And I'll be there
[01:26.700]You've got a friend
[01:29.850]
[01:37.770]If the sky above you Carole King
[01:42.870]Grows dark and full of clouds
[01:47.920]And that old north wind begins to blow
[01:59.260]Keep your head together
[02:04.080]And call my name out loud
[02:09.450]Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
[02:16.530]
[02:18.840]You just call out my name

[02:45.940]All you have to do is call
[02:50.660]And I'll be there
[02:56.310]Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
[03:01.480]
[03:02.310]When people can be so cold
[03:06.170]They'll hurt you, and desert you
[03:11.220]And take your soul if you let them
[03:16.430]Oh, but don't you let them
[03:20.300]
[03:21.410]You just call out my name Gloria Estefan
[03:27.540]And you know wherever I am
[03:31.780]I'll come running to see you again

[03:52.750]And I'll be there
[03:57.970]You've got a friend
[04:03.260]You've got a friend
[04:08.370]You've got a friend
