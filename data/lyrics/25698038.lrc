[00:47.740]

[00:57.580]It's hard to get by just upon a smile
[01:05.200]Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
[01:11.220]I'll always remember you like a child, girl
[01:16.460]

[01:21.840]And it's breaking my heart in two
[01:25.590]'Cause I never wanna see you a sad girl
[01:29.240]Don't be a bad girl
[01:31.820]But if you wanna leave, take good care
[01:35.510]I hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
[01:39.430]But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware
