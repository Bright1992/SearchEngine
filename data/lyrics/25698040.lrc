[00:13.550]I'm sitting here in a boring room
[00:16.590]It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
[00:20.010]I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do
[00:23.290]I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you
[00:26.530]But nothing ever happens and I wonder
[00:31.770]
[00:33.480]I'm driving around in my car
[00:36.870]I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far
[00:40.070]I'd like to change my point of view
[00:43.250]I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
[00:46.630]But nothing ever happens, and I wonder
[00:51.510]
[00:53.710]I wonder how, I wonder why
[00:57.040]Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
[01:00.300]And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
[01:06.710]I'm turning my head up and down
[01:10.400]I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
[01:13.640]And all that I can see is just a yellow (another) lemon tree
[01:20.720]La, la da dee da, etc.
[01:31.610]
[01:33.980]I'm sitting here, I miss the power
[01:37.170]I'd like to go out taking a shower
[01:40.360]But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
[01:43.710]I feel so tired, put myself into bed
[01:47.160]Where nothing ever happens and I wonder
[01:51.880]
[01:54.780]Isolation is not good for me
[02:01.340]Isolation I don't want to sit on a lemon tree
[02:07.640]I'm stepping around in a dessert of joy
[02:10.810]Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
[02:13.940]And everything will happen and you'll wonder
[02:20.160]
[02:21.040]I wonder how, I wonder why
[02:24.430]Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
[02:27.540]And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
[02:34.000]I'm turning my head up and down
[02:37.730]I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
[02:40.990]And all that I can see is just a yellow (another) lemon tree
[02:46.640]
[02:48.010]I wonder how I wonder why
[02:51.190]Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
[02:54.350]And all that I can see
[02:57.910]And all that I can see (dit dit dit)
[03:01.190]And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
[03:08.620]
