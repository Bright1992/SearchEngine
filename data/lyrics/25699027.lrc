[00:21.830]I see the crystal raindrops fall
[00:24.790]And the beauty of it all
[00:27.340]When the sun comes shining through
[00:32.250]To make those rainbows in my mind
[00:35.940]When I think of you some time
[00:38.140]I want to spend some time with you
[00:41.110]
[00:41.950]Just the two of us
[00:44.390]We can make it if we try
[00:47.000]Just the two of us
[00:49.520]Just the two of us
[00:51.860]Just the two of us
[00:54.490]Building castles in the sky
[00:57.420]Just the two of us
[01:00.200]You and I
[01:02.530]
[01:03.650]We look for love, no time for tears
[01:06.570]Wasted waters's all that is
[01:08.740]It don't make no flowers grow
[01:13.940]Good things might come to those who wait
[01:17.000]Not for those who wait too late
[01:19.420]We got to go for all we know
[01:22.640]
[01:24.040]Just the two of us
[01:26.230]We can make it if we try
[01:28.740]Just the two of us
[01:31.220]Just the two of us
[01:33.680]Just the two of us
[01:36.280]Building castles in the sky
[01:39.350]Just the two of us
[01:41.690]You and I
[01:43.920]
[02:06.230]I hear the crystal raindrops fall
[02:09.210]On the window down the hall
[02:11.650]And it becomes the morning dew
[02:16.780]Darling, when the morning comes
[02:19.480]And I see the morning sun
[02:22.070]I want to be the one with you
[02:25.320]
[02:25.900]Just the two of us
[02:28.130]We can make it if we try
[02:31.340]Just the two of us
[02:33.730]Just the two of us
[02:36.240]Just the two of us
[02:38.760]Building big castles way on high
[02:41.660]Just the two of us
[02:44.190]You and I
[02:46.340]
[02:48.780]Just the two of us
[02:54.130]Let's get together, baby
[02:59.550]Just the two of us
[03:04.360]We can make it
[03:07.900]Just the two of us
[03:10.380]We can make it
[03:11.980]Just the two of us
[03:15.680]You and I
[03:17.880]Just the two of us
