[00:15.579]starry, starry night
[00:22.330]paint your palette blue and grey
[00:27.700]
[00:28.820]look out on a summer's day
[00:33.640]with eyes that know the darkness in my soul
[00:38.730]shadows on the hills
[00:42.220]
[00:45.160]sketch the trees and the daffodils
[00:51.840]catch the breeze and the winter chills
[00:57.300]in colors on the snowy linen land
[01:02.250]
[01:05.990]now i understand what you tried to say to me
[01:18.000]
[01:18.200]how you suffered for your sanity
[01:24.710]how you tried to set them free
[01:27.770]they would not listen, they did not know how
[01:34.970]perhaps they'll listen now
[01:41.890]starry, starry night
[01:46.320]
[01:49.189]flaming flowers that brightly blaze
[01:55.370]swirling clouds in violet haze
[02:00.120]reflect in vincent's eyes of china blue
[02:05.680]colors changing hue
[02:12.179]morning field of amber grain
[02:18.719]weathered faces lined in pain
[02:23.839]are smoothed beneath the artist's loving hand
[02:28.209]now i understand what you tried to say to me
[02:40.719]how you suffered for your sanity
[02:45.579]
[02:46.978]how you tried to set them free
[02:50.728]they would not listen, they did not know how
[02:58.159]perhaps they'll listen now
[03:01.769]for they could not love you
[03:06.999]but still your love was true
[03:15.379]and when no hope was left in sight
[03:19.309]on that starry, starry night
[03:23.599]you took your life, as lovers often do
[03:30.599]but i could have told you, vincent
[03:34.159]this world was never meant for one
[03:38.670]as beautiful as you
[03:47.529]starry, starry night
[03:54.499]portraits hung in empty halls
[04:01.690]frameless head on nameless walls
[04:05.569]with eyes that watch the world and can't forget
[04:11.499]like the strangers that you've met
[04:17.928]
[04:19.190]all the ragged men in the ragged clothes
[04:24.789]the silver thorn of bloody rose
[04:29.499]lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
[04:35.640]now i think i know what you tried to say to me
[04:47.130]how you suffered for your sanity
[04:53.549]how you tried to set them free
[04:59.359]they would not listen, they're not listening still
[05:07.990]perhaps they never will
