[00:07.84]I know that it might sound strange
[00:12.26]But you made my seasons start to change
[00:16.50]It happened so suddenly
[00:20.79]Like heaven has waited up for me
[00:27.78]I've just been looking so long
[00:29.92]Kept meeting my Mr.Wrong
[00:32.10]In every model and every size
[00:36.49]Now my fantasy
[00:38.54]Is staring at your eyes
[00:44.39]Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
[00:47.55]But I don't know
[00:49.73]I'll keep it to myself
[00:52.95]You say it,It feels wonderful
[00:56.14]My smile can show
[00:58.28]I'm lost in paradise
[01:04.10]The letters you wrote to me
[01:08.14]Showed me the sogns I've never seen
[01:12.20]I thought every man I'd want
[01:16.51]Falls out of a dating magazine
[01:23.45]But I konw that with you
[01:25.62]That was so far from the truth
[01:27.74]On every page and evert line
[01:32.02]Now you're my everything
[01:34.03]I guess you know how to read my mind
[01:40.06]Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
[01:43.29]But I don't know
[01:45.40]I'll keep it to myself
[01:48.60]You say it,It feels wonderful
[01:51.80]My smile can show
[01:53.99]I'm lost in paradise
[02:00.60]I know
[02:03.52]I guess that it shows
[02:08.09]The message that flows to me
[02:12.71]Makes it more worth than make believe
[02:16.51]Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
[02:19.72]But I don't know
[02:21.80]I'll keep it to myself
[02:25.12]You say it,It feels wonderful
[02:28.25]My smile can show
[02:30.42]I'm lost in paradise
[02:33.72]Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
[02:36.81]But I don't know
[02:39.02]I'll keep it to myself
[02:42.24]You say it,It feels wonderful
[02:45.44]My smile can show
[02:47.59]I'm lost in paradise
