[00:24.589]One step too far
[00:27.970]All at once I'm falling
[00:30.280]Just like a star,I'm buring for you
[00:35.700]Thought I could keep myself from feeling this way
[00:41.040]I guess that was my first mistake
[00:47.500]Cause suddenly I'm walking
[00:49.350]Down a dark street to your door
[00:52.220]Wanting you is driving me insane
[00:58.090]And now my feet are standing
[01:00.850]Where they've never stood before
[01:03.890]Guided by a twist of fate
[01:09.500]If I lose myself with you tonight
[01:15.260]Fall apart or hold on tight
[01:20.940]Wrong or right
[01:23.360]I won't be afraid
[01:26.380]Cause evev if my heart should break
[01:31.860]You'd be the best mistake I ever made
[01:39.350]I'm in your room
[01:43.600]Now there's no denying
[01:45.120]What's in your eyes
[01:48.428]When I look at you
[01:51.000]Tow shadows talking but they don't make a sound
[01:55.850]Words have lost their meaning now
[02:01.290]And the air has turned electric
[02:04.290]Now I know the time is right
[02:07.280]To put myself into your hands
[02:13.149]And suddenly I'm shaking
[02:15.839]As your fingers touch my skin
[02:18.839]I don't need to understand
[02:23.839](but)If I lose myself with you tonight
[02:30.399]Fall apart or hold on tight
[02:36.209]Wrong or right
[02:38.209]I won't be afraid
[02:41.399]Cause evev if my heart should break
[02:46.520]You'd be the best mistake I ever made
[02:52.520]And if tomorrow proves me wrong
[02:58.839]I swear I don't belong
[03:04.899]I know I 'll carry on
[03:09.399]So I will lose myself and brave my soul
[03:16.499]Take this chance cause heaven knows
[03:21.490]I'm so far gone my choice is made
[03:27.300]And even if my heart should break
[03:33.460]When I lose myself with you tonight
[03:40.979]Fall apart or hold on tight
[03:46.009]Wrong or right
[03:48.570]I'll always say
[03:51.570]You're the best mistake I ever made
[03:57.890]You're the best mistake I ever made
[04:03.199]You're the best mistake I ever made
