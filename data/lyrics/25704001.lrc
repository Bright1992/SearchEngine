[00:00.550]I'm wide awake
[00:05.590]I'm wide awake
[00:12.560]I'm wide awake
[00:14.500]Yeah, I was in the dark
[00:15.320]I was falling hard
[00:16.690]With an open heart
[00:18.230]I'm wide awake
[00:20.500]How did I read the stars so wrong
[00:24.660]I'm wide awake
[00:26.400]And now it's clear to me
[00:27.310]That everything you see
[00:28.750]Ain't always what it seems
[00:30.180]I'm wide awake
[00:32.000]Yeah, I was dreaming for so long
[00:36.170]I wish I knew then
[00:37.290]What I know now
[00:38.800]Wouldn't dive in
[00:40.330]Wouldn't bow down
[00:41.770]Gravity hurts
[00:43.420]You made it so sweet
[00:44.680]Till I woke up on
[00:46.210]On the concrete
[00:48.600]Falling from cloud 9
[00:53.560]Crashing from the high
[01:00.350]I'm letting go tonight
[01:05.600]（Yeah I'm） Falling from cloud 9
[01:12.560]I'm wide awake
[01:13.550]Not losing any sleep
[01:15.330]Picked up every piece
[01:16.800]And landed on my feet
[01:18.140]I'm wide awake
[01:18.320]Need nothing to complete myself - nooohooo
[01:24.580]I'm wide awake
[01:25.830]Yeah, I am born again
[01:27.200]Outta the lion's den
[01:28.580]I don't have to pretend
[01:30.600]And it's too late
[01:31.460]The story's over now, the end
[01:36.180]I wish I knew then
[01:37.420]What I know now
[01:38.690]Wouldn't dive in
[01:40.190]Wouldn't bow down
[01:41.729]Gravity hurts
[01:43.310]You made it so sweet
[01:44.660]Till I woke up on
[01:46.140]On the concrete
[01:49.000]Falling from cloud 9
[01:54.700]Crashing from the high
[02:00.220]I'm letting go tonight （yeah, I'm letting go）
[02:06.430]I'm Falling from cloud 9
[02:13.420]Thunder rumbling
[02:16.300]Castles crumbling
[02:19.100]I am trying to hold on
[02:24.270]God knows that I tried
[02:28.790]Seeing the bright side
[02:31.400]But I'm not blind anymore...
[02:36.230]I'm wide awake
[02:42.550]I'm wide awake
[02:47.120]Yeah, I'm Falling from cloud 9
[02:53.510]Crashing from the high
[03:00.560]You know I'm letting go tonight
[03:06.320]I'm Falling from cloud 9
[03:12.370]I'm wide awake
[03:18.730]I'm wide awake
[03:24.690]I'm wide awake
[03:30.690]I'm wide awake
[03:36.740]I'm wide awake
