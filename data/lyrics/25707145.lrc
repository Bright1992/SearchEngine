[00:30.870]I use to be myself
[00:31.919] And use to play around
[00:33.698] Sometime I don't want to think
[00:39.018] Maybe cause I'm afraid
[00:41.198] I do wanna sing my song
[00:46.598] No matter what you say
[00:48.988] With you I never think
[00:52.598] along~
[00:55.008] I lood into my soul
[00:56.688] One day I hope somepoeple talk to me
[00:59.718] About life
[01:03.008] But I can't take no more
[01:07.087] Where where where where my Shangri-la
[01:11.998] I do wanna sing my song
[01:14.689] No matter what you say
[01:17.887] With you I never think
[01:21.289] along~
[01:23.259] I lood into my soul
[01:25.509] One day I hope somepoeple talk to me
[01:28.058] About life
[01:31.689] But I can't take no more
[01:35.948] Where...where...where...where my Shangri-la
[01:38.909] Many many time I want to go
[01:44.290] So I hardly open my eyes
[01:46.798] The truth even force me run...run...run...run away...run away
[01:50.939] But now I'm same to you
[01:59.248] But I feel nothing better for sure

[02:30.000] So I hardly open my eyes
[02:33.000] The truth even force me run...run...run...run away...run away
[02:34.520] But now I'm same to you
[02:44.000] But I feel nothing better for sure
[02:48.200] The star...star...star would you take me away
