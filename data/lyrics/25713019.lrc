[00:13.670]How many times you asked yourself before
[00:19.420]What’s the point
[00:23.160]wasting time
[00:26.580]But how many times you stand up for yourself
[00:33.390]Make a point
[00:36.850]you have a reason
[00:40.500]You know
[00:43.180]it’s not fair
[00:47.050]Your life
[00:49.900]belongs to nobody else
[00:54.330]So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
[01:01.100]You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
[01:07.830]So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
[01:14.250]Just open your eyes
[01:16.100]you got everything in the world
[01:21.800]How many times you want to give up yourself
[01:27.740]Once again
[01:30.920]there’s no point
[01:34.920]But how many times you kept on moving on
[01:41.220]Once again
[01:44.620]you have a reason
[01:48.620]You know
[01:51.250]it’s not fair
[01:55.170]Your life
[01:57.840]belongs to nobody else
[02:01.850]So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
[02:09.110]You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
[02:15.910]So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
[02:22.880]Just open your eyes
[02:24.420]you got everything in the world
[02:30.770]Does it make you wonder?
[02:34.350]Is it karma or is it fate
[02:37.560]Is it you
[02:40.870]or is it me
[02:43.770]Oh does it really make you falter
[02:47.830]Does it make you want to believe?
[02:51.250]It is true
[02:53.850]you’re like nobody else
[02:58.660]So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
[03:05.060]You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
[03:11.620]So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
[03:18.540]Just open your eyes
[03:20.380]you got everything in the world
[03:25.290]Just open your eyes
[03:27.330]you got everything in the world
[03:32.590]I open my eyes
[03:34.690]I have you in my world
[03:41.170]
