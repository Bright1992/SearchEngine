[00:03.43]Ohh...Ohhh....uh...
[00:13.75]Lately I've been thinkin',
[00:16.85]Thinkin' bout what we had,
[00:19.85]I know it was hard,
[00:21.30]It was all that we knew, yeah
[00:25.53]Have you been drinkin'?
[00:28.52]To take all the pain away,
[00:31.42]I wish that I could give you what you deserve...
[00:37.32]'Cause nothing can ever,
[00:40.24]Ever replace you.
[00:43.14]Nothing can make me feel like you do, yeah.
[00:48.90]You'd know there's no one
[00:51.90]I can relate to,
[00:54.81]I know we won't find a love that's so true...
[00:58.69]There's nothing like us,
[01:01.58]There's nothing like you and me,
[01:05.21]Together through the storm.
[01:10.69]There's nothing like us,
[01:13.56]There's nothing like you and me,
[01:16.88]Together, oh
[01:24.10]I gave you everything, babe,
[01:27.60]Everything I had to give.
[01:30.34]Girl, why would you push me away? yeah
[01:35.89]Lost in confusion,
[01:38.92]Like an illusion,
[01:41.79]You know I'm used to making your day...
[01:47.62]But that is the past now,
[01:50.52]We didn't last now,
[01:53.56]I guess that this is meant to be, yeah...
[01:59.30]Tell me, was it worth it?
[02:02.29]We were so perfect.
[02:05.35]But, baby, I just want you to see...
[02:09.20]There's nothing like us,
[02:11.78]There's nothing like you and me,
[02:15.35]Together through the storm.
[02:20.81]There's nothing like us,
[02:23.55]There's nothing like you and me,
[02:26.88]Together, oh
[02:32.49]There's nothing like us,
[02:35.38]There's nothing like you and me,
[02:39.19]Together through the storm.
[02:44.10]There's nothing like us,
[02:46.97]There's nothing like you and me,
[02:50.74]Together, oh...
