[00:02.990]I had a way then
[00:04.468]losing it all on my own
[00:08.469]I had a heart then
[00:10.619]but the queen has been overthrown
[00:16.300]and I'm not sleeping now
[00:20.349]the dark is too hard to beat
[00:24.829]and I'm not keeping up
[00:28.940]the strength I need to push me
[00:32.829]you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[00:37.699]you shine them when im alone
[00:40.339]and so I tell myself that i'll be strong
[00:45.099]on even when they're gone
[00:48.369]cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
[00:54.590]calling, calling, calling home
[00:56.649]you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[01:01.290]you shine them when I'm alone
[01:09.100]noises, I play within my head
[01:13.029]touch my own skin
[01:15.709]and hope they'll still be there
[01:20.529]and I think back to when
[01:24.608]my brother and my sister slept
[01:28.929]in another place
[01:33.029]the only time I feel safe
[01:37.588]you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[01:41.178]you shine them when i'm alone
[01:44.999]and so i tell myself that I'll be strong
[01:49.049]and dreaming when they‘re gone
[01:52.408]cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
[01:57.209]calling, calling, calling home
[02:01.499]you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[02:04.978]you shine them when I'm alone
[02:09.859]lights, lights (x14)
[02:25.299]you show the lights that stop me
[02:30.390]lights that
[02:33.119]and so I tell myself that I'll be strong
[02:37.409]and dreaming when they're gone
[02:40.918]cause they’re calling, calling, calling me home
[02:45.439]calling, calling, calling home
[02:49.039]you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[02:53.359]you shine them when I'm alone
[02:57.879]home, home
[03:02.500](lights, lights, lights)...
