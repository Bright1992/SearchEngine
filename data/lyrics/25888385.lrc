[00:15.91]Boy you were getting ready to leave
[00:17.93]I thought baby you have done
[00:20.46]Cause for a while you can barely look at me.
[00:23.30]This time I thought that we'd be fine
[00:27.02]That I'd forget the things that you said
[00:28.93]I tried crossing out your words
[00:31.80]But baby you can not forget the past (x2)
