[00:27.73]You don't know what's in store

[00:53.56]Hold tight for this ride
[01:00.80]We don't need no protection

[01:29.38]Even though, you don't roll
[01:35.87]Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

[02:32.87]Open your hand, take a glass
[02:39.56]Don't be scared, I'm right here
[02:46.10]Even though, you don't roll
