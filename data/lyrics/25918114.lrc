[00:01.50]Breathing you in when I want you out
[00:06.00]Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
[00:10.55]Lying inside our quiet drama
[00:18.86]Wearing your heart like a stolen dream
[00:23.08]Opening skies with your broken keys
[00:26.96]No one can blind us any longer
[00:33.56]We'll run where lights won't chase us
[00:37.80]Hide where love can save us
[00:41.55]I will never let you go
[00:48.68]We'll run where lights won't chase us
[00:53.10]Hide where love can save us
[00:57.08]I will never let you go
[01:20.06]We'll run where lights won't chase us
[01:24.79]Hide where love can save us
[01:29.32]I will never let you go
