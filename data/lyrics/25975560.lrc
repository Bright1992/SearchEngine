[00:12.510]I let it fall, my heart
[00:16.240]And as it fell, you rose to claim it
[00:20.850]It was dark and I was over
[00:24.950]Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
[00:29.760]My hands, they were strong
[00:33.690]but my knees were far too weak
[00:38.610]To stand in your arms
[00:42.510]without falling to your feet
[00:46.980]But there's a side to you
[00:49.550]that I never knew, never knew
[00:51.770]All the things you'd say
[00:53.930]they were never true, never true
[00:56.110]And the games you'd play
[00:58.520]you would always win, always win
[01:01.960]But I set fire to the rain
[01:07.000]Watched it pour as I touched your face
[01:11.450]Well, it burned while I cried
[01:13.650]'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
[01:18.360]your name
[01:20.930]When laying with you I could stay there
[01:27.490]Close my eyes, feel you here forever
[01:33.650]You and me together, nothing is better
[01:38.170]'Cause there's a side to you
[01:40.590]that I never knew, never knew
[01:42.800]All the things you'd say
[01:44.930]they were never true, never true
[01:47.210]And the games you's play
[01:49.530]you would always win, always win
[01:53.090]But I set fire to the rain
[01:58.390]Watched it pour as I touched your face
[02:03.130]Well, it burned while I cried
[02:05.360]'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
[02:10.050]your name
[02:11.850]I set fire to the rain
[02:16.450]And I threw us into the flames
[02:20.950]Well, I felt something die
[02:23.100]'Cause I knew that that was the last time
[02:27.570]the last time
[02:29.790]Sometimes I wake up by the door
[02:34.250]And heard you calling must be waiting for you
[02:38.720]Even that when we're already over
[02:43.220]I can't help myself from looking for you
[02:47.620]I set fire to the rain
[02:52.030]Watched it pour as I touch your face
[02:56.490]Well, it burned while I cried
[02:58.750]'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
[03:03.400]your name
[03:05.280]I set fire to the rain
[03:09.870]And I threw us into the flames
[03:14.280]Well, I felt something die
[03:16.430]'Cause I knew that that was the last time
[03:20.960]the last time, oh
[03:27.680]Oh, no
[03:31.770]Let it burn, oh
[03:40.650]Let it burn
[03:49.610]Let it burn
