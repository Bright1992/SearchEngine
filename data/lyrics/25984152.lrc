[00:21.410]I know just how to whisper and I know just how to cry.
[00:28.370]I know just where to find the answers and I know just how to lie.
[00:35.340]I know just how to fake it and I know just how to scheme.
[00:42.360]I know just when to face the truth and then I know just when to dream.
[00:49.230]And I know just where to touch you and I know just what to prove.
[00:56.420]I know when to pull you closer and I know when to let you loose.
[01:03.160]And I know the night is fading. And I know the time's gonna fly.
[01:10.260]And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you,
[01:14.130]But I know I've got to give it a try.
[01:17.610]And I know the roads to riches. And I know the ways to pain.
[01:24.340]I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
[01:28.280]And I always know the name of the game.
[01:31.670]But I don't know how to leave you and I'll never let you fall.
[01:40.640]And I don't know how you do it, making love out of nothing at all.
[01:50.260](Making love) Out of nothing at all.

[02:13.840]
[02:16.100]Everytime I see you well the rays of the sun are all streaming through the waves in your hair.
[02:22.990]And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes like a spotlight.
[02:29.870]The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost and it's looking for a rhythm like you.
[02:38.460]You can take the darkness from the deep of the night,
[02:41.780]And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright.
[02:46.630]I gotta follow it cause everything I know,
[02:49.180]Well, it's nothing 'til I give it to you.
[02:53.400]
[03:17.140]I can make you run or stumble. I can make the final clock.
[03:23.850]And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle.
[03:27.190]And I can make all the stadiums rock.
[03:30.730]I can make the night forever or I can make it disappear by the dawn.
[03:37.640]And I can make you every promise that's ever been made.
[03:41.280]And I can make all your demons be gone.
[03:44.870]But I'm never gonna make it without you.
[03:48.710]Do you really wanna see me crawl?
[03:54.000]And I'm never gonna make it like you do,
[03:57.630]Making love out of nothing at all.
