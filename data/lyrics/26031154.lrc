[ti:Never let you go]
[ar:卫兰]
[00:15.903]The rain just never seems to bring
[00:20.911]the joy I feel the same
[00:23.651]everlasting pain of my loss remains
[00:29.766]My heart can't seem to learn to part
[00:35.680]the hold you left the mark
[00:37.706]all that I dreamed of now it seems so stark
[00:43.431]Tho I told myself won't hold my breath
[00:47.704]a part of me was dying
[00:50.938]there is nothing left for me to do now but give in
[00:59.108]If you gave me one more chance to tell you
[01:02.020]how i was feeling
[01:05.110]I would sing to you and tell you I won't
[01:09.888]live my life without you
[01:12.989]If you gave me one more chance to tell you
[01:16.117]how i was feeling
[01:19.384]I would hold your hand and look in your eyes
[01:23.977]and ya know I'd never let you go
[01:40.420]The way you left me on the train
[01:45.493]I don't know what to say
[01:48.306]I remember everything in that day
[01:54.443]I can't believe we'd never dance
[01:59.853]I just need one more chance
[02:02.352]to share the sunset our one last romance
[02:08.106]Tho I told myself won't hold my breath
[02:12.387]a part of me was dying
[02:15.607]there is nothing left for me to do now but give in
[02:23.642]If you gave me one more chance to tell you
[02:26.692]how i was feeling
[02:29.773]I would sing to you and tell you I won't
[02:34.528]live my life without you
[02:37.701]If you gave me one more chance to tell you
[02:40.776]how i was feeling
[02:43.845]I would hold your hand and look in your eyes
[02:48.718]and ya know I'd never let you go
[03:09.461]If you gave me one more chance to tell you
[03:12.533]how i was feeling
[03:15.617]I would sing to you and tell you I won't
[03:20.532]live my life without you
[03:23.574]If you gave me one more chance to tell you
[03:26.703]how i was feeling
[03:29.733]I would hold your hand and look in your eyes
[03:34.516]and ya know I'd never let you go
