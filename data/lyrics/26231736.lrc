[00:04.210]Take my fate in your hands
[00:06.950]We've got a lot that hasn’t even began
[00:10.510]Something is calling us
[00:12.260]We’re breaking free
[00:13.870]I’m curious
[00:15.190]I need to see.
[00:17.060]Like a flash before our eyes
[00:20.300]We're already into the night
[00:23.240]And if it feels like we’re dreaming,
[00:25.920]Believe it, believe it
[00:28.470](Yeah)
[00:29.720]We don't have to wait 'til the morning,
[00:32.850]The sun will never go down
[00:35.070]And we won't be this way forever
[00:38.900]We've got to take it now

[00:49.930]
[00:52.500]Bring me down, side by side
[00:55.130]While our reflections make our bodies collide
[00:58.610]So full of energy, nothing to hide
[01:01.870]No need to sleep, we come alive,
[01:04.920]And if we’re gonna take this ride
[01:08.350]We can go wherever we like
[01:11.720]And if it feels like we’re dreaming
[01:13.970]Believe it, believe it
[01:16.400](Yeah)

[02:28.490]We're going on a journey
[02:29.660]It was over like a flash before our eyes
[02:32.360]flashing on a journey
