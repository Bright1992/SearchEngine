[00:00.35]Yes I do, I believe
[00:03.62]That one day I will be
[00:05.92]where I was
[00:06.84]Right there, right next to you
[00:10.06]And it's hard
[00:11.66]The days just seem so dark
[00:13.76]The moon, the stars
[00:15.21]are nothing without you
[00:17.68]Your touch, your skin
[00:20.30]where do I begin?
[00:22.00]No words can explain
[00:24.00]the way I'm missing you
[00:27.46]The night,this emptiness
[00:29.73]this hole that I'm inside
[00:31.36]These tears, they tell their own story
[00:34.98]You told me not to cry when you were gone
[00:43.25]But the feeling's overwhelming
[00:47.09]it's much too strong
[00:51.51]Can I lay by your side
[01:00.00]next to you, you
[01:08.50]And make sure you're alright
[01:15.58]I'll take care of you
[01:21.58]And I don't want to be here
[01:23.97]if I can't be with you tonight
[01:33.95]I'm reaching out to you
[01:41.26]Can you hear my call?
[01:50.50]This hurt that I've been through
[01:56.16]I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
[02:06.95]You told me not to cry when you were gone
[02:15.04]But the feeling's overwhelming,
[02:18.36]it's much too strong
[02:23.37]Can I lay by your side
[02:31.50]next to you, you
[02:39.74]And make sure you're alright
[02:46.69]I'll take care of you
[02:52.01]And I don't wanna be here
[02:54.00]if I can't be with you tonight
[03:04.32]Lay me down tonight
[03:11.97]Lay me by your side
[03:19.47]Lay me down tonight
[03:27.17]Lay me by your side
[03:34.32]Can I lay by your side
[03:42.00]next to you, you
