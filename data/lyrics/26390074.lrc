[00:02.92]
[00:15.40]Hush, don't speak
[00:16.95]
[00:18.08]When you spit your venom,
[00:19.91]
[00:20.11]keep it shut I hate it
[00:21.52]
[00:21.70]When you hiss and preach
[00:23.72]
[00:24.43]About your new messiah '
[00:25.76]
[00:25.91]cause your theories catch fire
[00:27.86]
[00:28.44]I can't find your silver lining
[00:31.10]
[00:31.41]I don't mean to judge
[00:33.17]
[00:34.54]But when you read your speech, it's tiring
[00:37.77]
[00:37.94]Enough is enough
[00:40.32]
[00:41.38]I'm covering my ears like a kid
[00:43.11]
[00:44.26]When your words mean nothing,
[00:46.28]
[00:46.41]I go la la la
[00:47.31]
[00:47.80]I'm turning off the volume when you speak
[00:50.32]
[00:51.01]Cause if my heart can't stop it,
[00:52.54]
[00:53.02]I  find a way to block it I go
[00:54.49]
[00:57.54]I  find a way to block it I go
[00:57.76]
[01:00.01]I can't stop it
[01:00.70]
[01:00.92]I  find a way to block it I go
[01:01.85]
[01:07.75]I  find a way to block it I go
[01:08.36]
[02:16.36]I'm covering my ears like a kid
[02:18.42]
[02:19.01]When you words mean nothing
[02:20.74]
[02:20.94]I go la la la
[02:21.41]
[02:22.49]I'm turning off the volume when you speak
[02:24.35]
[02:25.43]Cause if my heart can't stop it
[02:26.87]
[02:27.51]I find a way to block it I go
[02:30.12]
