[00:09.580]Flying kites
[00:11.360]With boy wonder
[00:13.570]Hold tight
[00:15.90]To me all summer
[00:16.640]
[00:17.600]Reading my magazines
[00:21.570]Dancing in my blue jeans
[00:24.570]
[00:24.870]Pucker up in sunglasses
[00:26.830]Making love to the flashes
[00:28.850]Posing the way that we do for everybody to see
[00:32.850]Polaroid through your lashes
[00:34.840]Only thing that will last is
[00:36.860]I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
[00:41.380]
[00:44.920]I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
[00:49.420]
[00:52.830]I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
[00:56.990]
[00:57.350]Tomorrow always happens too soon
[01:01.590]I wish I had an electric moon
[01:06.250]To save the light
[01:09.440]
[01:17.580]Fireworks
[01:19.380]And night streamers
[01:21.600]Baby blue
[01:23.130]With the day dreamers
[01:24.920]
[01:25.550]Under water
[01:27.530]Close to me
[01:29.539]Hold my breath
[01:31.70]In my blue jeans
[01:32.620]
[01:32.860]Pucker up in sunglasses
[01:34.850]Making love to the flashes
[01:36.880]Posing the way that we do for everybody to see
[01:40.820]Polaroid through your lashes
[01:42.870]Only thing that will last is
[01:44.840]I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
[01:49.330]
[01:52.930]I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
[01:57.410]
[02:00.900]I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
[02:05.150]
[02:05.380]Tomorrow always happens too soon
[02:09.590]I wish I had an electric moon
[02:14.150]To save
[02:16.940]
[02:17.880]I wanna live tonight
[02:21.910]I wanna sing the light
[02:25.910]And we go on and on and on
[02:27.950]And we go on and on and on
[02:29.950]I wanna li-i-ive
[02:31.860]We wanna li-i-ive
[02:33.970]
[02:34.250]I wanna live tonight
[02:37.860]I wanna sing the light
[02:41.840]And we go on and on and on
[02:43.900]And we go on and on and on
[02:45.910]I wanna li-i-ive
[02:47.829]We wanna li-i-ive
[02:49.970]And tonight
[02:54.240]
[02:55.180]I take a picture of you
[02:56.850]Taking a picture of me
[02:58.780]Tonight Oh Oh
[03:02.890]I take a picture of you
[03:04.870]Taking a picture of me
[03:07.150]
[03:07.420]Tomorrow always happens too soon
[03:11.610]I wish I had an electric moon
[03:16.160]To save the light
