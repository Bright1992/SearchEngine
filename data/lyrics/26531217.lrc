[00:19.14]Do you think about me when you're all alone?
[00:22.33]
[00:23.45]The things we used to do, we used to be
[00:26.51]
[00:28.39]I could be the one to make you feel that way
[00:32.07]
[00:32.94]I could be the one to set you free
[00:36.30]
[00:37.75]Do you think about me when the crowd is gone?
[00:41.30]
[00:42.26]It used to be so easy, you and me
[00:45.45]
[00:47.19]I could be the one to make you feel that way

[00:55.63]
[01:17.86]I could be the one to make you feel that way
[01:21.69]
[01:22.49]I could be the one to set you free
[01:26.07]
[01:27.25]I could be the one to make you feel that way
[01:30.96]
[01:31.90]I could be the one to set you free
[01:35.58]
[01:38.95]When you need a way to beat the pressure down
[01:42.57]
[01:43.64]When you need to find a way to breathe
[01:47.69]
[01:48.47]I could be the one to make you feel that way
[01:52.11]
[01:52.86]I could be the one to set you free
[01:57.02]
[01:57.70]If you never see me when the crowd is gone
[02:01.33]
[02:02.27]It used to be so easy, can't you see?
[02:05.64]
[02:07.26]I could be the one to make you feel that way
[02:10.90]
[02:11.73]I could be the one to set you free...
[02:16.40]
[02:35.38]I could be the one to make you feel that way
[02:39.11]
[02:39.92]I could be the one to set you free
[02:43.67]
[02:44.80]I could be the one to make you feel that way
[02:48.55]
[02:49.43]I could be the one to set you free
