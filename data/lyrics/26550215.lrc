[00:16.910]I'm at a payphone trying to call home
[00:25.410]All of my change I spent on you
[00:30.070]Where have the times gone
[00:33.900]Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
[00:40.240]Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
[00:43.810]The people we used to be
[00:46.430]It's even harder to picture
[00:48.820]That you're not here next to me
[00:51.370]You say it's too late to make it
[00:53.970]But is it too late to try?
[00:56.430]And in our time that you wasted
[00:58.880]All of our bridges burned down
[01:02.070]I've wasted my nights
[01:04.430]You turned out the lights
[01:06.940]Now i'm paralyzed
[01:09.990]Still stucked in that time when we called it love
[01:14.340]But even the sun sets in paradise
[01:19.800]I'm at a payphone trying to call home
[01:24.420]All of my change I spent on you
[01:29.300]Where have the times gone
[01:32.880]Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
[01:39.820]If happy ever after did exist
[01:44.480]I would still be holding you like this
[01:49.910]And all those fairytales are full of shit
[01:54.560]One more fucking love song i'll be sick
[02:01.330]
[02:02.370]You turned your back on tomorrow
[02:06.220]Cause you forgot yesterday
[02:08.430]I gave you my love to borrow
[02:11.140]But you just gave it away
[02:13.190]You can't expect me to be fine
[02:16.230]I don't expect you to care
[02:18.490]I know i've said it before
[02:21.090]But all of our bridges burned down
[02:24.200]I've wasted my nights
[02:26.540]You turned out the lights
[02:29.150]Now i'm paralyzed
[02:31.960]Still stucked in that time when we called it love
[02:36.410]But even the sun sets in paradise
[02:42.120]I'm at a payphone trying to call home
[02:47.190]All of my change I spent on you
[02:51.830]Where have the times gone
[02:55.540]Baby It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
[03:01.680]If happy ever after did exist
[03:06.900]I would still be holding you like this
[03:11.800]And all those fairytales are full of shit
[03:16.680]One more fucking love song i'll be sick
[03:21.720]Now i'm at a payphone...
