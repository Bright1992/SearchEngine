[00:09]I was standin’ with my friend
[00:10]When i saw you walkin’ in
[00:12]And my heart started skippin’ a beat

[00:15]But i knew it was true
[00:16]That nobody would ever compete
[00:19]Well first comes love and then comes…
[00:24]First date first kiss
[00:25]We were checkin’ off the list
[00:27]Then you were gettin’ down on your knee
[00:29]And you didn’t have to guess
[00:31]It was a always a yes
[00:32]Now there’s 2 less fish in the sea

[00:44]I love the ring of your name
[00:46]You’re the ying to my yang
[00:47]Oh baby let’s give it a shot
[00:50]Every wall needs a frame
[00:51]Every ball needs a chain
[00:52]I’m talkin’ about tying the knot
[00:54]Tie it up
[01:00]Something old, something new
[01:01]Something borrowed, something blue
[01:03]And the chairs lined up in the yard
[01:05]The i do’s and the kisses

[01:56]Yeah, I’m fit to be tied down
[02:04]When Mama’s kicked off her shoes
[02:05]And Daddy’s spinnin’ from the booze
[02:06]And the last song is finally sung
