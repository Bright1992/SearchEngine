[00:18.840]Spend all your time waiting for that second chance,
[00:25.830]for a break that would make it okay.
[00:31.346]There's always one reason to feel not good enough,
[00:38.859]and it's hard at the end of the day.
[00:43.335]I need some distraction oh beautiful release
[00:51.467]memory seeps from my veins
[00:56.739]let me be empty and weightless and maybe
[01:03.626]I'll find some peace tonight
[01:09.697]in the arms of an angel
[01:14.858]fly away from here
[01:21.669]from this dark cold hotel room
[01:30.597]and the endlessness that you fear
[01:39.837]you are pulled from the wreckage
[01:48.089]of your silent reverie
[01:52.988]you're in the arms of the angel
[01:58.176]may you find some comfort here
[02:15.519]you're in the arms of the angel
[02:19.930]may you find some comfort here
