[00:01.00]Billie Jean (Extended) - Michael Jackson
[00:43.06]She was more like a beauty queen
[00:44.93]
[00:45.51]from a movie scene
[00:46.76]I said don't mind but
[00:48.15]what do you mean i am the one
[00:50.51]
[00:52.01]Who will dance
[00:53.38]on the floor in the round
[00:54.63]
[00:55.65]She said i am the one
[00:58.58]
[01:00.51]who will dance
[01:01.31]on the floor in the round
[01:02.75]
[01:07.43]She told me her name
[01:08.75]was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
[01:11.44]Then every head turned with eyes
[01:12.93]that dreamed of being the one
[01:15.24]
[01:17.11]Who will dance
[01:17.92]on the floor in the round
[01:19.29]
[01:23.36]People always told me
[01:25.18]be careful what you do
[01:26.63]
[01:27.44]Don't go around breaking
[01:29.00]young girls' hearts
[01:29.68]
[01:31.86]And mother always told
[01:33.11]me be careful who you love
[01:34.74]
[01:35.68]And be careful
[01:36.43]what you do cuz
[01:37.61]the lie becomes the truth
[01:38.74]
[01:40.64]Billie Jean is not my lover
[01:42.94]
[01:44.55]She's just a girl who claims
[01:46.75]that i am the one
[01:48.00]
[01:48.81]But the kid is not my son
[01:51.86]
[01:54.80]She says i am the one
[01:56.42]
[01:57.97]but the kid is not my son
[02:00.04]
[02:05.65]For forty days and forty nights
[02:07.09]
[02:07.64]the law was on her side
[02:09.15]But who can stand
[02:09.48]when she's in demand
[02:10.80]her schemes and plans
[02:11.98]
[02:14.49]Cuz we danced
[02:15.44]on the floor in the round
[02:16.81]
[02:19.43]So take my strong advice
[02:20.92]
[02:22.48]Just remember to always think twice
