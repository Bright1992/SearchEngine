[00:25.790]如命悬十秒 以内 我想 你在
[00:39.140]如若忘掉你 呼吸 不再
[00:48.590]
[00:52.700]如突然害怕 怯懦 记得 我在
[01:05.720]如没沦陷过 不懂 所爱
[01:15.300]
[01:18.680]I will be on my way to save you
[01:25.990]
[01:27.420]When life goes astray
[01:31.610]
[01:32.680]I'll be on my way to hold you
[01:39.360]
[01:40.610]To kiss your tears away
[01:45.040]
[01:46.470]And my heart will stay
[01:51.830]
[01:53.890]Stay with you for no reason
[01:58.450]
[01:59.410]Even if I'm away…away…
[02:09.960]
[02:12.530]回望如幻觉 以内 记忆 以外
[02:25.110]
[02:25.730]留默言动作 心中 装载
[02:35.720]
[02:38.580]I will be on my way to save you
[02:45.960]
[02:47.400]When life goes astray
[02:51.890]
[02:52.490]I'll be on my way to hold you
[02:58.980]
[03:00.590]To kiss your tears away
[03:05.280]
[03:06.330]And my heart will stay
[03:12.150]
[03:13.890]Stay with you for no reason
[03:19.020]Even if I'm away…away…
[03:30.820]
[03:32.320]从未能遇上 替代 各种 意外
[03:45.040]
[03:45.720]谁幸存度过 该懂 怎爱
