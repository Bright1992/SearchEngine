[00:48.30]Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
[00:50.60]I tried to be chill but you’re so hot that I melted
[00:54.08]I fell right through the cracks
[00:56.89]and now I’m trying to get back
[00:59.80]Before the cool done run out
[01:01.12]I’ll be giving it my bestest
[01:03.09]Nothing’s going to stop me but divine intervention
[01:05.85]I reckon it’s again my turn to win some or learn some
[01:12.07]But I won’t hesitate no more, no more
[01:18.73]It cannot wait, I’m yours
[01:36.87]Well open up your mind and see like me
[01:39.70]Open up your plans and damn you’re free
[01:42.60]Look into your heart and you’ll find love love love
[01:47.86]Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing
[01:51.96]We're just one big family
[01:54.52]And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved
[02:02.35]So I won't hesitate no more, no more
[02:09.50]It cannot wait, I'm sure
[02:14.56]There's no need to complicate
[02:18.43]our time is short
[02:21.49]This is our fate
[02:24.31]I'm yours
[02:26.66]D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do
[02:30.95]But do you want to come on
[02:32.01]Scooch on over closer dear
[02:35.00]And I will nibble your ear
[02:50.20]I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
[02:53.35]And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
[02:56.41]But my breath fogged up the glass
[02:58.86]And so I drew a new face and I laughed
[03:02.36]I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
[03:05.26]To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
[03:08.36]It's what we aim to do
[03:11.21]our name is our virtue
[03:14.37]But I won't hesitate no more, no more
[03:21.47]It cannot wait, I'm yours
[03:28.09]and open up your mind and see like me
[03:30.49]Open up your plans and damn you're free
[03:33.41]Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
[03:38.51]So please don't,please don't, please don't
[03:41.40]There's no need to complicate
[03:43.92]'Cause our time is short
[03:46.17]This is, this is, this is our fate
[03:48.57]I'm yours
[03:55.33]
