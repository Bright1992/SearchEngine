[00:10.710]I let it fall, my heart
[00:14.440]And as it fell, you rose to claim it
[00:19.050]It was dark and I was over
[00:23.150]Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
[00:27.960]My hands, they were strong
[00:31.890]but my knees were far too weak
[00:36.810]To stand in your arms
[00:40.710]without falling to your feet
[00:45.180]But there's a side to you
[00:47.750]that I never knew, never knew
[00:49.970]All the things you'd say
[00:52.130]they were never true, never true
[00:54.310]And the games you'd play
[00:56.720]you would always win, always win
[01:00.160]But I set fire to the rain
[01:05.200]Watched it pour as I touched your face
[01:09.650]Well, it burned while I cried
[01:11.850]'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
[01:16.560]your name
[01:19.130]When laying with you I could stay there
[01:25.690]Close my eyes, feel you here forever
[01:31.850]You and me together, nothing is better
[01:36.370]'Cause there's a side to you
[01:38.790]that I never knew, never knew
[01:41.000]All the things you'd say
[01:43.130]they were never true, never true
[01:45.410]And the games you's play
[01:47.730]you would always win, always win
[01:51.290]But I set fire to the rain
[01:56.590]Watched it pour as I touched your face
[02:01.330]Well, it burned while I cried
[02:03.560]'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
[02:08.250]your name
[02:10.050]I set fire to the rain
[02:14.650]And I threw us into the flames
[02:19.150]Well, I felt something die
[02:21.300]'Cause I knew that that was the last time
[02:25.770]the last time
[02:27.990]Sometimes I wake up by the door
[02:32.450]And heard you calling must be waiting for you
[02:36.920]Even that when we're already over
[02:41.420]I can't help myself from looking for you
[02:45.820]I set fire to the rain
[02:50.230]Watched it pour as I touch your face
[02:54.690]Well, it burned while I cried
[02:56.950]'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
[03:01.600]your name
[03:03.480]I set fire to the rain
[03:08.070]And I threw us into the flames
[03:12.480]Well, I felt something die
[03:14.630]'Cause I knew that that was the last time
[03:19.160]the last time, oh
[03:25.880]Oh, no
[03:29.970]Let it burn, oh
[03:38.850]Let it burn
[03:47.810]Let it burn
