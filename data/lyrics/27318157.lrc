[00:14.83]I don't wanna be left behind
[00:18.51]Distance was a friend of mine
[00:22.28]Catching breath in a web of lies
[00:25.48]I've spent most of my life
[00:29.85]Riding waves, playing acrobat
[00:33.51]Shadowboxing the other half
[00:37.28]Learning how to react
[00:40.57]I've spent most of my time
[00:45.26]Catching my breath, letting it go
[00:49.07]turning my cheek for the sake of the show
[00:52.74]Now that you know, this is my life
[00:56.45]I won't be told what's supposed to be right
[01:01.14]Catch my breath, no one can hold me back
[01:05.09]I ain't got time for that
[01:08.67]Catch my breath, won't let them get me down
[01:12.66]it's all so simple now
[01:15.00]Addicted to the love I found
[01:18.51]Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
[01:22.27]Making time for the ones that count
[01:25.57]I'll spend the rest of my time
[01:29.78]Laughing hard with the windows down
[01:33.46]Leaving footprints all over town
[01:37.32]Keeping faith karma comes around
[01:40.48]I will spend the rest of my life
[01:45.14]Catching my breath, letting it go
[01:48.88]turning my cheek for the sake of this show
[01:52.74]Now that you know, this is my life
[01:56.50]I won't be told what's supposed to be right
[02:00.99]Catch my breath, no one can hold me back
[02:05.16]I ain't got time for that
[02:08.74]Catch my breath, won't let them get me down

[02:16.45]You helped me see
[02:23.22]The beauty in everything
[02:30.29]Catching my breath, letting it go
[02:34.00]turning my cheek for the sake of this show
[02:37.77]Now that you know, this is my life
[02:41.59]I won't be told what's supposed to be right
