[00:01.20]In Crescent City I met a girl
[00:09.90]Who was as pretty as the light of day
[00:19.86]She was so pretty
[00:23.78]She would take your breath away
[00:34.51]In Crescent City I met a girl
[00:43.97]Who was as pretty as the rose in May
[00:52.36]But when I tried to say I love you
[00:57.21]I could find no words to say
[00:58.96]
[00:59.13]多少期待 多少梦想
[01:03.35]遗留在那条路上
[01:08.48]多少回忆 多少时光
[01:12.79]只剩一个人珍藏
[01:17.86]有几首歌 没人听过
[01:22.39]却会渐渐被遗忘
[01:27.75]是谁决定 谁的故事
[01:31.99]值得被别人欣赏
[01:35.14]
[01:36.96]In Crescent City I left a girl
[01:46.19]Who was more pretty than I care to say
[01:55.28]Although she was so pretty
[02:00.69]I could not stay
[02:03.33]
[02:36.78]In Crescent City I left a girl
[02:46.21]Who was more pretty than I care to say
[02:55.16]Although she was so pretty
[03:00.76]I could not stay
[03:05.42]I could not stay
[03:10.21]I could not stay
[03:15.15]I could not stay
[03:17.72]
