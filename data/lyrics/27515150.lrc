[00:00.700]I always want more
[00:03.580]I'm never gonna get it
[00:06.610]You're gonna be the one I never got that got away
[00:09.780]And I'll regret it
[00:12.200]Just a moment in time
[00:15.330]But I can't forget it
[00:19.330]Yeah, we almost said it
[00:24.420]If this is love, ooh
[00:28.400]I should be dying
[00:30.700]But I'm going downtown like I still care
[00:33.850]Like I'm still trying
[00:37.960]I said I was over you but I'm lying
[00:43.600]There, I almost said it
[00:50.300]Every time you look at me
[00:53.420]I say it silently
[00:55.440]Oh, when will you wake up and get it
[00:59.430]This close, we almost said it
[01:07.300]I know you're not evil
[01:10.289]So why do you tease me
[01:13.200]Yeah, staying around here late at night
[01:16.140]You don't make it easy
[01:20.590]It's in my body language, read me
[01:25.950]We were this close
[01:28.200]This close, yeah
[01:31.530]And it's like every time you look at me
[01:35.920]I say it silently
[01:38.390]Oh, wake up, baby, come and get it
[01:41.979]This close, we almost said it
[01:45.700]You say that you're still not free
[01:47.210]Well, I hear selectively
[01:50.210]That still means someday you might be
[01:54.680]Oh, this close, yeah, yeah
[02:01.730]You wrote me a song
[02:04.870]I often play it
[02:08.900]Depending on where I am with you
[02:09.930]I either love it or I hate it
[02:15.490]We were just this close but we couldn't say it
[02:20.690]We were this close
