[01:12.80]Hidden in the sun,
[01:16.590]For when the darkness comes.
[01:28.460]Now the door is open,
[01:32.830]The world I knew is broken.
[01:37.210]With no return.
[01:42.90]Now my heart is not scared,
[01:46.580]Just knowing that you're out there.
[01:51.710]Watching me.

[02:30.570]Hidden in the sun,
[02:35.70]For when the darkness comes.
[02:44.410]For when the darkness comes.
[02:50.160].
