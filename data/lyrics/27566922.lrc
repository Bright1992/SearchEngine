[00:05.480]I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
[00:08.110]Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
[00:10.770]So I sat quietly, agreed politely
[00:16.100]I guess that I forgot I had a choice
[00:18.770]I let you push me past the breaking point
[00:21.520]I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
[00:26.620]You held me down, but I got up
[00:29.330]Already brushing off the dust
[00:31.860]You hear my voice, your hear that sound
[00:34.870]Like thunder, gonna shake your ground
[00:37.270]You held me down, but I got up
[00:40.160]Get ready cause I've had enough
[00:42.460]I see it all, I see it now
[00:45.860]I got the eye of the tiger, the fire, dancing through the fire
[00:52.890]Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR
[00:59.860]Louder, louder than a lion
[01:03.460]Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR
[01:10.400]Oh oh oh oh oh oh
[01:17.420]You're gonna hear me roar
[01:22.940]Now I'm floating like a butterfly
[01:25.460]Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
[01:28.130]I went from zero, to my own hero
[01:33.040]You held me down, but I got up
[01:35.730]Already brushing off the dust
[01:38.460]You hear my voice, your hear that sound
[01:41.410]Like thunder, gonna shake your ground
[01:43.830]You held me down, but I got up
[01:46.830]Get ready 'cause I've had enough
[01:49.070]I see it all, I see it now
[01:52.280]I got the eye of the tiger, the fire, dancing through the fire
[01:59.530]'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR
[02:06.370]Louder, louder than a lion
[02:10.250]'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR
[02:16.730]Oh oh oh oh oh oh
[02:24.170]You're gonna hear me roar
[02:34.580]You're gonna hear me roar
[02:46.120]Roar-or, roar-or, roar-or
[02:53.860]I got the eye of the tiger, the fire, dancing through the fire
[03:00.960]'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR
[03:07.670]Louder, louder than a lion
[03:11.490]'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR
[03:18.000]Oh oh oh oh oh oh
[03:25.530]You're gonna hear me roar
[03:36.350]You're gonna hear me roar
