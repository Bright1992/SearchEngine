[00:19.090]I'm gonna be risky
[00:22.640]Life and soul of the party
[00:25.320]No more stressing me out
[00:27.250]Pulling me down
[00:28.020]Making me feel like I am better off lonely
[00:30.630]I'm gonna be fearless
[00:32.750]And take care of my business
[00:36.000]You stopped keeping me safe
[00:37.560]I need to be brave
[00:38.740]Shout it out
[00:39.500]Shout it out
[00:39.990]Shout it, shout it every day now
[00:42.000]Try steal my powers right from me
[00:44.300]Just like a criminal
[00:45.730]But I won't have it
[00:47.800]I'm not flying into your arms, no
[00:51.240]I never thought that you'd drain the fight out of me
[00:54.800]Oops, look what you did to me
[00:57.420]Now I figured out
[00:58.980]I don't need no hero-oooo...
[01:05.800]I can save myself no hero-oooo-oooo...
[01:12.040]Anything is possible, feeling indestructible
[01:16.840]I don't need no hero-oooo...
[01:21.150]I don't need no hero
[01:32.880]I'm living dangerous
[01:34.560]For what you did, I'll make you pay for it
[01:37.940]See, I know that you're scared
[01:39.560]Watching me over head
[01:40.690]Watch me, watch-watch me now
[01:41.870]I see you watch me every day now
[01:43.860]Can't steal my powers right from me
[01:46.310]Just like a criminal
[01:47.560]But I won't have it
[01:49.490]I'm not flying into your arms
[01:51.800]I never thought that you'd drain the fight out of me
[01:56.480]Oops, look what you did to me
