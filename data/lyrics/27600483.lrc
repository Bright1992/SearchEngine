[00:06.66]Catch My Breath
[00:10.42]Catch My Breath
[00:13.66]I don't wanna be left behind
[00:16.60]Distance was a friend of mine
[00:20.30]Catching breath in a web of lies
[00:23.96]I've spent most of my life
[00:28.45]Riding waves, playing acrobat
[00:31.78]Shadowboxing the other half
[00:35.22]Learning how to react
[00:38.86]I've spent most of my time
[00:43.42]Catching my breath  letting it go
[00:47.31]Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
[00:51.16]Now that you know  this is my life
[00:54.84]I won't be told what's supposed to be right
[00:58.98]Catch my breath
[01:02.17]no one can hold me back
[01:04.00]I ain't got time for that
[01:07.00]Catch my breath
[01:09.79]won't let them get me down
[01:11.57]It's all so simple now
[01:13.57]Addicted to the love I found
[01:17.11]Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
[01:20.72]Making time for the ones that count
[01:24.08]I'll spend the rest of my time
[01:28.75]Laughing hard with the windows down
[01:32.13]Leaving footprints all over town
[01:35.75]Keeping faith, karma comes around
[01:39.12]I will spend the rest of my life
[01:44.05]Catching my breath  letting it go
[01:47.69]Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
[01:51.55]Now that you know, this is my life
[01:55.03]I won't be told what's supposed to be right
[02:00.35]Catch my breath
[02:02.33]no one can hold me back
[02:04.15]I ain't got time for that
[02:06.16]Catch my breath
[02:09.91]won't let them get me down
[02:11.77]It's all so simple now
[02:13.80]It's all so simple now
[02:26.49]You helped me see
[02:37.78]The beauty  The beauty
[02:44.90]You helped me see
[02:52.12]The beauty in everything in everything
[03:00.99]Catching my breath
[03:16.45]Catch my breath
[03:18.15]no one can hold me back
[03:19.96]I ain't got time for that
[03:22.46]Catch my breath
[03:25.73]won't let them get me down
[03:27.57]It's all so simple now
[03:36.85]Catch my breath
[03:40.89]I've spent most of my life
[03:45.48]Catch my breath
