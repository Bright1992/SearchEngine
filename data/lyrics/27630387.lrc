[00:07.700]I had a way then
[00:10.950]Losing it all on my own
[00:15.260]I had a heart then
[00:18.310]But the queen has been overthrown
[00:23.370]And I'm not sleeping now
[00:27.490]The dark is too hard to beat
[00:31.480]And I'm not keeping up
[00:35.470]The strength I need to push me
[00:39.280]You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[00:43.520]You shine them when I'm alone
[00:47.210]And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
[00:52.140]And dreaming when they're gone
[00:54.890]Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home
[00:59.630]Calling, calling, calling home
[01:03.560]You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[01:07.430]You shine them when I'm alone
[01:13.500]Noises, I play within my head
[01:19.289]Touch my own skin
[01:22.900]And hope they'll still be there
[01:27.150]And I think back to when
[01:31.270]My brother and my sister slept
[01:35.580]In another place
[01:39.440]The only time I feel safe
[01:43.440]You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[01:47.620]You shine them when I'm alone
[01:51.110]And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
[01:55.170]And dreaming when they're gone
[01:58.720]Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home
[02:03.590]Calling, calling, calling home
[02:07.580]You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[02:11.450]You shine them when I'm alone
[02:16.100]Lights, lights...
[02:31.460]You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[02:35.650]You shine them when I'm alone
[02:39.510]And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
[02:43.260]And dreaming when they're gone
[02:47.100]Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home
[02:51.630]Calling, calling, calling home
[02:55.550]You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
[02:59.680]You shine them when I'm alone
[03:02.980]Home, home
[03:04.980]Lights, lights, lights...
