[00:32.019]Bite chunks out of me
[00:34.079]
[00:35.389]You’re a shark and I’m swimming
[00:37.699]
[00:38.939]heart still thumps as I bleed
[00:41.499]
[00:42.499]And all your friends come sniffing
[00:46.049].
[00:46.739]Triangles are my favorite shape
[00:48.929]
[00:50.419]Three points where two lines meet
[00:53.039]
[00:53.919]Toe to toe, back to back,
[00:55.709]let’s go, my love very late
[00:59.790]
[01:00.269]‘Til morning comes, let’s tessellate
[01:06.509].
[01:06.939]
[01:08.439]Go alone my flower
[01:12.369]
[01:15.189]And keep my whole lovely you
[01:19.799]
[01:22.109]Wild green stones alone my lover
[01:26.969]
[01:30.590]keep us on my heart
[01:34.799].
[01:35.119]
[02:07.940]Three guns and one goes off
[02:10.190]
[02:11.500]One’s empty, one’s not quick enough
[02:13.750]
[02:15.370]One burn, one red, one grin
[02:18.230]Search the graves while the camera spins
[02:21.170]
[02:21.730].
[02:22.290]Chunks of you will sink down to seals
[02:24.980]
[02:26.040]Blubber rich in mourning, they’ll nosh you up
[02:31.170]Yes, they’ll nosh the love away but it’s fair to say
[02:33.540]
[02:34.600]You will still haunt me
[02:36.100].
[02:36.350]
[02:37.470]Triangles are my favorite shape
[02:39.780]
[02:41.220]Three points where two lines meet
[02:44.100]
[02:44.650]Toe to toe, back to back,
[02:46.330]let’s go my love; it’s very late
[02:50.080]
[02:51.070]‘Til morning comes,
[02:52.630]
[03:27.580]Wild green stones alone my lover
[03:33.000]
[03:36.060]keep us on my heart
