[00:00.00]When was the last time we got to be one hundred percent real, y'all
[00:05.95]I don't want y'all holding back nothing
[00:17.57]Who do we think we are?
[00:23.10]Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
[00:30.75]We make a lot of magic
[00:34.79]It's the only way we, we know
[00:42.58]Let's keep the night fantastic
[00:46.40]Light it up tell me more, explore
[00:54.52]We love, we love, we love, we love the stars
[01:00.39]We could fall so hard
[01:06.47]The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars
[01:12.39]Why'd we ball so hard?
[01:18.69]Yeah, I'm no afraid to fly
[01:29.97]Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
[01:34.41]And we're not afraid to die
[01:41.70]Who do we think we are?
[01:45.41]Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
[01:53.12]Who do we think we are?
[01:57.52]Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
[02:06.70]We've got a lot of nerve, girl
[02:09.82]We walk around here like we own this place
[02:22.10]See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands
[02:24.33]Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent
[02:27.51]Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce
[02:30.53]Eggplant double-breasted suit from Tom Ford
[02:33.65]Bon voyage, left haters in the fog
[02:36.42]Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss
[02:39.37]Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us
[02:42.36]Still actin' shy like this is summer class crush
[02:45.38]Money comin' fast, I'm never in a rush, no
[02:49.36]Plus another twenty in the tuck
[02:51.15]Semi in a truck, in another forty on the wrist
[02:53.75]Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin' like I pitch
[02:57.34]Dodging Robin Givens, balling like I'm Roger Clemens
[03:00.36]Still in the game, uniform all linen
[03:03.80]She get Chanel, ski trips to Ville
[03:05.98]Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale
[03:09.70]I'm no afraid to fly
[03:20.20]Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
[03:25.92]And we're not afraid to die
[03:31.31]Who do we think we are?
[03:35.72]Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
[03:43.20]Who do we think we are?
[03:47.58]Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
[03:55.56]Who do we think we are?
[03:59.64]I don't know about y'all, but I feel good tonight
[04:05.81]There's something in the air tonight
[04:11.19]You know, everybody needs someone to look up to
[04:15.61]Why shouldn't it be us?
[04:18.99]Who do we think we are?
[04:24.47]Tell me, who do we think we are?
[04:30.75]Who do we think we are?
[04:36.46]Tell me, who do we think we are?
[04:46.17]This is our song, is our song for the future
