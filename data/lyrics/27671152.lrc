[00:04.44]You don't need a lot of money
[00:10.70]And you don't have to play no games
[00:17.67]All I need is all your lovin'
[00:23.65]To get the blood rushing through my veins
[00:29.85]I wanna say we're going steady
[00:37.04]Like it's 1954
[00:43.45]It doesn't have to be forever
[00:48.78]Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart, ohh
[01:22.46]You don't need to worry about
[01:28.12]Makin' me crazy
[01:31.12]'Cause I'm way past that
[01:36.08]So just call me if you want me
[01:39.41]'Cause you got me, and I'll show you
[01:42.76]How much I wanna be on your tattooed heart, ohh
[02:08.92]Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart
[02:18.66]Wrap me in your jacket, my baby
[02:24.21]And lay me in your bed
[02:29.10]And kiss me underneath the moonlight
[02:36.30]And let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart, ohh
[03:02.54]As long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart
