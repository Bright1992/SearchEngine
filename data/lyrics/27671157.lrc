[00:19.030]I like to blame it all on life
[00:25.150]Maybe we just weren't right
[00:29.460]But that's a lie that's a lie
[00:35.150]And we can deny it as much as we want
[00:41.150]But in time our feelings will show
[00:46.830]Cause sooner or later
[00:49.830]We'll wonder why we gave up
[00:52.710]The truth is everyone knows
[01:00.710]Almost almost is never enough
[01:07.770]So close to being in love
[01:13.580]If I would have known that you wanted me
[01:19.020]The way I wanted you
[01:22.270]Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
[01:28.330]But right here in each others arms
[01:33.760]And we almost we almost knew what love was
[01:42.950]But almost is never enough
[01:47.640]If I could change the world overnight
[01:53.390]There'd be no such thing as goodbye
[01:59.200]You'll be standing right where you were
[02:03.640]We'd get the chance we deserve
[02:09.510]Try to deny it as much as you want
[02:15.200]But in time our feeling will show
[02:21.140]Cause sooner or later
