[00:09.260]I'm a red and fragile rose
[00:11.190]Won't grow in the dark alone

[00:44.570]You make my head shake
[00:46.760]I watch the glass break
[00:49.000]I never thought it's like tonight
[00:53.440]Just like a mystic
[00:55.630]You make my earth quake
[00:57.880]You feel like thunder in sky
[01:01.320]Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh oh)
[01:06.180]Thunder, thunder, thunder
[01:10.340]Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh oh oh oh)
[01:15.780]You feel like thunder in sky
[01:20.160]Broke free, saw an open road
[01:22.280]Footsteps led me to your soul
[01:24.470]Now I run with a hunted goat
[01:28.970]Never thought I'd be this happy
