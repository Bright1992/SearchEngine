[00:13.639]Did someone give you something to help you ease the pain?
[00:20.619]Like the liquor in the bottle, we watched you slip away.
[00:27.529]And I feel as if I know you through the bars of a song.
[00:35.150]Always surrounded but alone.
[00:39.830]
[00:43.0]But no goodbyes, you’ll always be Miss America.
[00:48.930]We watched you fly, but nothing’s free Miss America.
[00:55.550]And as you fall apart, we just call it art.
[01:01.720]Was it so hard to breathe?
[01:07.500]Was the picture in the paper not the face you recognise?
[01:13.220]Did the make up never make up for the pain behind your eyes?
[01:19.850]Cos I feel as if I know when you’re on my silver screen
[01:26.130]But I don’t know the dark places that you’ve been.
[01:30.800]
[01:33.580]But no goodbyes, you’ll always be Miss America.
[01:39.650]We watched you fly, but nothing’s free Miss America.
[01:45.878]And as you fall apart, we just call it art.
[01:51.900]Was it so hard to breathe?
[01:55.580]
[01:57.720]Does another voice sing in Heaven’s choir tonight,
[02:03.890]To fill the silence left behind?
[02:09.657]And I don’t know what goes on in your mind
[02:15.499]I’m sure it’s enough to make me cry.
[02:20.529]Someday we’ll find you lived forever.
[02:27.899]
[02:28.689]But no goodbyes, you’ll always be Miss America.
[02:35.209]We watched you fly, but nothing’s free Miss America.
[02:41.978]And as you fall apart, we just call it art.
[02:48.359]Was it so hard to breathe?
[02:53.299]
