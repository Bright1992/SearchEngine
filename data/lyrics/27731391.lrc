[00:21.190]This is what I look like today
[00:24.080]And I'm trying not to pull out my hair
[00:29.150]I'm trying how to grow it but I'm far too shy to show it back there
[00:37.210]That is probably why I like wearing hats
[00:41.080]There's no denying I'm deferring the facts
[00:45.940]Avoiding confrontation
[00:46.520]Lacks tact in a situation
[00:48.300]Behind every line is a lesson yet to learn
[00:54.310]But if you ask me
[00:58.590]The feeling that I'm feeling is overwhelming
[01:02.300]And oh, it goes to show
[01:04.190]I've so much to know
[01:09.570]I wrote this for my prettiest friend
[01:13.030]But while trying not to prove that I care
[01:18.840]I was trying not to make all my moves in one motion and scare her away
[01:27.990]She can't see she's making me crazy now
[01:32.090]I don't believe she knows she's amazing how
[01:35.260]She has me holding my breathe
[01:38.520]So I'd never guess that I'm a none such unsuitable, suited for her
[01:44.570]And if you ask me
[01:49.290]The feeling that I'm feeling is complimentery
[01:53.080]And oh, it goes to show
[01:56.810]The moral of the story is boy loves girl
[02:00.930]And so on but the way that it unfolds is yet to be told
[03:14.320]I know that I should be brave
[03:18.880]Even pretty can be seen by the blind
[03:22.800]I know that I cannot wait
[03:26.880]Until the day we finally learn how to find each other
[03:30.940]Redefining open minds
[03:35.900]And if you ask me
[03:38.100]The feeling that I'm feeling is overjoyed
[03:41.620]And it's golden, it goes to show then
[03:46.320]The ending of this song should be left alone
[03:49.760]And so on 'cause the way it unfolds is yet to be told
