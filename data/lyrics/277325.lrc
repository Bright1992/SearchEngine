[00:15.200] Why do birds suddenly appear
[00:22.840]Every time you are near
[00:29.910]Just like me, they long to be
[00:35.860]Close to you
[00:40.870]Why do stars fall down from the sky
[00:47.970]Every time you walk by
[00:57.030]Just like me, they long to be
[01:01.300]Close to you
[01:07.460]On the day that you were born
[01:13.490]And the angels got to gether
[01:15.530]And decided to create a dream come true
[01:19.790]So they sprinkled moon dust
[01:23.440]In your hair of gold
[01:25.350]And starlight in your eyes of blue
[01:31.390]That is why all the girls in town
[01:38.800]Follow you all around
[01:45.040]Just like me, they long to be
[01:52.050]Close to you
[02:24.290]On the day that you were born
[02:27.630]And the angels got to gether
[02:29.850]And decided to create a dream come true
[02:35.780]So they sprinkled moon dust
[02:38.600]In your hair of gold
[02:40.830]And starlight in your eyes of blue
[02:47.770]That is why all the girls in town
[02:55.410]Follow you all around
[03:02.090]Just like me, they long to be
[03:08.210]Close to you
[03:15.150]Just like me, they long to be
[03:21.310]Close to you
