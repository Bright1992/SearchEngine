[01:02.140]Feeling my way through the darkness
[01:06.140]Guided by a beating heart
[01:10.000]I don't care where the journey will end
[01:13.990]But I know where to start.
[01:17.610]hey tell me I'm too young to understand
[01:21.480]They say I'm caught up in a dream
[01:25.230]My life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
[01:29.470]Well its fine by me.
[01:31.780]so wake me up when its all over
[01:36.090]When I'm wiser and I'm older
[01:39.830]All this time I was finding myself
[01:43.140]And I didn't know I was lost.
[01:47.370]so wake me up when its all over
[01:50.940]When I'm wiser and I'm older
[01:55.490]All this time I was finding myself
[01:58.370]And I didn't know I was lost.
[02:51.180]I tried carrying the weight of the world
[03:10.410]But I only have two hands
[03:14.690]I hope I get the chance to travel the world
[03:17.480]I don't have any plans.
[03:22.020]Wish that I could stay forever this young
[03:25.710]Not afraid to close my eyes
[03:29.700]Life's a game made for everyone
[03:33.880]And love is the prize
[03:36.070]so wake me up when its all over
[03:39.750]When I'm wiser and I'm older
[03:44.170]All this time I was finding myself
[03:47.420]And I didn't know I was lost.
[03:51.670]so wake me up when its all over
[03:55.620]When I'm wiser and I'm older
[03:59.620]All this time I was finding myself
[04:04.010]And I didn't know I was lost.
[04:09.450]I didn't know I was lost.
