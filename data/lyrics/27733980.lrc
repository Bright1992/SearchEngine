[00:22.260]Oh baby the day you stepped into my world
[00:26.820]You noticed I’m the kind of girl
[00:29.640]Who loves her diamonds and white pearls
[00:34.570]So you told me to jetset away in London
[00:39.750]To sip on some tea
[00:42.330]You surprise me with gifts from Tiffany
[00:45.230]Oh la la la la la la la la
[00:47.560]I love the way we're living boy
[00:50.520]But my daddy say; "you don’t need that boy"
[00:53.830]So let’s run away  let’s run away
[01:00.390]Momma say I’m too young for love
[01:03.200]And loving you is all I’m thinking of
[01:06.450]My heart tells me that you’re the one
[01:09.700]It’s the feeling you give  it is
[01:14.720]Like you’ve got the key to my heart
[01:17.770]Simple as a touch and a kiss
[01:21.090]Never knew a feeling like this
[01:23.570]Pure bliss  pure bliss
[01:27.600]Nobody can tear us apart
[01:29.970]Baby it’s as good as it gets
[01:32.370]Kiss kiss kiss
[01:33.890]Loving you will never be hard
[01:36.640]This is pure bliss
[01:50.330]I remember when the pilot closed the door
[01:55.390]Said it’s time for lift off
[01:58.360]You said; what’d you choose me for
[02:02.010]But don’t ever wonder
[02:05.140]Cause you deserve the best
[02:08.210]Once you reach the top
[02:10.830]You’ll never question why you left
[02:14.960]Oh my world is yours
[02:19.330]What you waiting for
[02:22.520]Let’s run away  let’s run away
[02:28.460]Our friends say we’re crazy
[02:31.650]But we can’t listen baby
[02:34.720]They’ve never had it like this
[02:37.830]They don’t know what it is
[02:41.150]Pure bliss
[02:42.830]Like you’ve got the key to my heart
[02:46.270]Simple as a touch and a kiss
[02:49.520]Never knew a feeling like this
[02:52.080]Pure bliss  pure bliss
[02:55.780]Nobody can tear us apart
[02:58.990]Baby it’s as good as it gets
[03:00.990]Kiss kiss kiss
[03:02.110]Loving you will never be hard
[03:05.050]This is pure bliss
