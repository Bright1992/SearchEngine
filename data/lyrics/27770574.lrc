[00:21.690]Every day is a day in paradise
[00:23.940]I choose to view my life
[00:26.560]Is not a dream I can see
[00:28.190]how the world is alive,
[00:30.420]Is ever changing
[00:32.290]Every season's a brand new style and dress
[00:34.470]Every day gets my Sunday best
[00:36.970]but many hours I lay awake,
[00:39.080]wondering how the hell you are today
[00:42.270]'Cause as carefree as you came to me
[00:44.760]you turn around and became a memory
[00:47.440]You know how I know god loves me?
[00:49.760]'Cause I'm still standing
[00:52.440]I don't miss you 'cause I'm always thinking about you in my arms
[01:02.300]I don't miss you 'cause I'm always living with you in my heart
[01:19.030]Not every night does the moon rise red
[01:20.700]Low in the sky just above our heads
[01:23.760]You only get a little minute to hold it,
[01:26.570]Let's just enjoy each moment
[01:29.130]I enjoy the intensity of being your boy,
[01:32.690]and you being there for me
[01:34.440]For many moons I reminisce
[01:36.370]And keep the light for ever led, yeah
[01:39.990]As quickly as you came to me
[01:42.110]you took a bow and became a memory
[01:44.670]You know how I know god loves me?
[01:47.170]'Cause I'm still standing
[01:49.850]I don't miss you 'cause I'm always thinking about you in my arms
[02:00.020]I don't miss you 'cause I'm always living with you in my heart
[02:16.430]I'm in a place of peace
[02:17.990]And I'm holding you up to the highest
[02:21.360]Well I'm grateful for the ride, yes
[02:23.920]I still love you
[02:31.470]I don't miss you 'cause I'm always thinking about you in my arms
[02:41.890]I don't miss you 'cause I'm always living with you down in my heart
[02:52.500]I don't miss you 'cause I'm always thinking about you wherever you are
[03:02.860]I don't miss you 'cause I'm always living with you deep down in my heart
[03:13.340]I don't miss you 'cause I'm always, always, always thinking about you
[03:23.630]I don't miss you 'cause I'm always, always, always living with you
[03:37.990]Down in my heart, in my heart.
