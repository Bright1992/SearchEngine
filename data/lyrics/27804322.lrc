[00:05.29]A lone fool out in the sun
[00:08.93]Your heartbeat of solid gold
[00:12.72]I love you, you'll never know
[00:16.37]When the daylight comes you feel so cold,
[00:21.21]You know
[00:23.74]I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go
[00:28.97]Waiting for the fire to light
[00:31.81]Feeling like we could do right
[00:36.49]Be the one that makes tonight
[00:40.18]'Cause freedom is a lonely road
[00:43.96]We're under control
[00:46.21]
[01:14.81]We're under control
[01:17.30]
[01:24.88]I might be anyone
