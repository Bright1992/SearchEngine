[00:14.309]She's another victim of life, we've come to know,
[00:20.490]Technology, celebrity, all the things you cannot hold
[00:24.500]She's from a long lost tribe looking for the light
[00:27.599]Or a friend to hold her hand
[00:29.900]She's doing the best she can
[00:33.940]
[00:34.840]Seems that everyone we knows is
[00:37.340]Out there waiting by a phone
[00:39.790]Wondering why they feel alone
[00:42.350]In this life
[00:43.740]
[00:46.190]Are we all just satellites?
[00:48.740]Where's the love? Show me tonight
[00:51.290]Here's the moment we unite
[00:56.730]For all we know life's just to dream
[00:59.400]Who the hell knows what it means?
[01:01.490]Stop the world and sing with me
[01:04.000]
[01:09.340]All her memories have been
[01:11.590]Experienced through
[01:13.690]High speed on a video screen
[01:16.900]That's all she ever knew
[01:18.800]Did you know none of it's real if you can't feel
[01:21.110]The beating of someone's heart
[01:23.610]Don't leave yourself in the dark
[01:27.370]
[01:28.320]Seems that everyone we knows is
[01:30.880]Out there waiting by a phone
[01:33.229]Wondering why they feel alone
[01:35.890]In this life
[01:37.300]
[01:39.750]Are we all just satellites?
[01:42.450]Where's the love? Show me tonight
[01:45.000]Here's the moment we unite
[01:50.280]For all we know life's just to dream
[01:52.740]Who the hell knows what it means?
[01:55.130]Stop the world and sing with me
[01:57.670]
[02:05.680]Are we satellites?
[02:15.719]Are we satellites?
[02:17.719]
[02:23.209]Are we all just satellites?
[02:25.769]Where's the love? Show me tonight
[02:28.320]Here's the moment we unite
