[00:12.200]There are times when I don't know where I stand
[00:16.779]You make me feel like I'm a boy and not a man
[00:24.299]There are times when you don't give me a smile
[00:28.660]I lie awake at night and worry for a while
[00:36.300]It's OK 'cause I know
[00:39.200]You shine even on a rainy day
[00:42.100]I can find your halo
[00:44.940]Guides me to wherever you fall
[00:51.110]If you need a hand to hold
[00:56.990]I'll come running, we come
[00:59.520]You and I won't part till we die
[01:04.209]You should know
[01:07.920]We see eye to eye, heart to heart.
[01:12.400]
[01:24.600]There are times when I cry 'cause you said "no tears"
[01:28.840]And I'm so far away but your body's right here
[01:36.600]There are times when I just walked at your door
[01:40.789]And thought I'd never get to see you anymore.
[01:48.600]It's OK 'cause I know
[01:50.850]You shine even on a rainy day
[01:53.840]I can find your halo
[01:56.920]Guides me to wherever you fall
[02:03.000]If you need a hand to hold
[02:08.788]I'll come running, we come
[02:11.519]You and I won't part till we die
[02:16.200]You should know
[02:19.349]We see eye to eye, heart to heart.
[02:24.920]Ohoohoohoooo sometimes
[02:35.599]Ohoohoohoooo
[02:46.799]Wherever you fall
[02:50.719]If you need a hand to hold
[02:56.499]I'll come running, we come
[02:59.239]You and I won't part till we die
[03:03.969]You should know
[03:07.200]We see eye to eye, heart to heart.
[03:11.890]
[03:18.209]I can find your halo
[03:20.950]Guides me to wherever you fall
[03:24.539]
