[00:15.489]Did all the words I never said
[00:17.490]hurt as bad as those I did ?
[00:20.299]You know I never even cared not before you.
[00:24.258]If I could go and turn back time,
[00:26.790]If I could only press rewind
[00:29.278]I would bleed this heart of mine
[00:31.769]Just to show you
[00:33.669]I'll be the first to say I'm sorry,
[00:37.690]The first to say I'm stupid
[00:39.639]Why do I always take it there
[00:41.879]
[00:42.879]Is it hopeless or maybe you still want to
[00:46.859]Meet me at the altar ?
[00:49.349]And I will lay it all to bare
[00:52.490]And I told you all my secrets, all my fears, I've let go.
[01:01.459]And it's flawless,
[01:04.248]You are the only one,
[01:06.789]You are the only one,
[01:09.229]Don't you know,
[01:13.900]Don't you know ?
[01:14.990]Am I faded from your mind
[01:15.949]Has the distance blurred the lines ?
[01:18.389]They say all things heal with time
[01:20.879]But its untrue
[01:22.769]I will linger on every word
[01:25.689]I know it's more than I deserve
[01:28.990]Chances are I'll make it worse,
[01:30.679]But I need to
