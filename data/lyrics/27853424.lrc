[00:04.190]Oh God it hurt
[00:05.580]The moment that I saw you
[00:07.819]With someone else
[00:09.309]The one that you belong to
[00:11.549]I never thought
[00:13.239]I'd drown in my shallow
[00:15.530]Heart
[00:19.509]I'd like to say
[00:20.860]The things I never used to
[00:23.990]But come today they wont ever be useful
[00:26.980]I never learnt to use my shallow
[00:30.660]Heart
[00:34.550]I, I, I
[00:36.190]I never meant to hurt you
[00:40.800]It's just something I do
[00:43.810]I guess it's not a good excuse
[00:48.980]
[00:51.700]And she will always hate me
[00:54.260]No matter what I say
[00:58.690]And there is no mistaking
[01:01.130]The love is gone
[01:04.510]
[01:06.310]She will always hate me
[01:10.400]She said, "You lost me baby."
[01:13.930]No matter what I say
[01:16.420]The love is gone
[01:19.910]
[01:20.850]Looking back I guess I'm holding onto
[01:24.490]The good we had
[01:25.880]But I know it's wrong to
[01:28.120]Because in the end
[01:29.660]She's never gonna hold my heart
[01:32.650]
[01:35.890]And now she knows
[01:37.289]She doesn't want to know me
[01:39.770]I'm not suppose to be the one that's lonely
[01:43.460]I never thought that she could have a cold, cold
[01:46.990]Heart
[01:47.900]
[01:50.929]I, I, I
[01:52.620]I never meant to hurt you
[01:56.509]It's just something I do
[02:00.250]I guess it's not a good excuse
[02:05.170]
[02:07.200]And she will always hate me
[02:11.230]No matter what I say
[02:15.600]And there is no mistaking
[02:17.600]The love is gone
[02:20.929]
[02:22.769]She will always hate me
[02:26.450]She said, "You lost me baby."
[02:30.390]No matter what I say
[02:32.820]The love is gone
[02:36.260]
[02:36.810]I, I, I
[02:38.450]I never meant to hurt you
[02:42.290]It's just something I do
[02:46.170]I guess it's not a good excuse
[02:49.310]
[02:53.339]And she will always hate me
[02:57.120]No matter what I say
[03:00.959]And there is no mistaking
[03:03.399]The love is gone
[03:06.829]
[03:08.679]She will always hate me
[03:12.459]She said, "You lost me baby."
[03:16.299]No matter what I say
[03:18.790]The love is gone
[03:22.470]
