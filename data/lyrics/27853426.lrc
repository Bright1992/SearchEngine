[00:00.900]Sundays sitting on your back porch
[00:03.088]And I came up with a couple of cords
[00:05.229]And I played for you
[00:10.700]You let me keep you entertained
[00:12.810]With stories I exaggerate
[00:15.050]That you know aren't true
[00:18.140]And as you sit there making daisy chains
[00:20.830]And I throw in a hand granate
[00:23.180]And tell you how it is I really feel for you
[00:27.720]I'm sending postcards from my heart
[00:32.170]With love for a postmark and then..
[00:35.828]You know that you make me feel like we've been caught
[00:41.389]Like kids in the school yard again
[00:45.538]And I can't keep it to myself
[00:49.890]Can't spell it any better
[00:52.068]L.O.V.E forever
[00:55.098]I hope you know that I'm sending a postcard
[01:01.400]I don't care who sees what I sent
[01:04.599]Or if the whole world knows what's in my head
[01:17.569]We chased the sun til it got away
[01:19.719]On a bicycle that your daddy made
[01:21.910]But not made for two
[01:25.948]Then we sat out on your rocking chair
[01:29.148]You with a flower in your hair
[01:31.990]That I found for you
[01:36.389]But then monday always comes around
[01:38.709]And it's sad 'cause I can't see you now
[01:41.059]Wan't you to know you're always in my head
[01:45.508]I'm sending postcards from my heart
[01:48.188]With love for a postmark and then..
[01:51.978]You know that you make me feel like we've been caught
[01:57.938]Like kids in the school yard again
[02:02.019]And I can't keep it to myself
[02:06.160]Can't spell it any better
[02:08.800]L.O.V.E forever
[02:11.970]I hope you know that I'm sending a postcard
[02:17.150]I don't care who sees what I sent
[02:22.000]Or if the whole world knows what's in my head
[02:43.570]You know sometimes it's hard to see
[02:46.070]You say the world that torture me
[02:48.700]But inside I know exactly how I feel
[02:53.340]The things that I can't say out loud
[02:55.580]I'll find a place to write it down
[02:58.120]I hope that they will find you in the end
[03:02.600]I'm sending postcards from my heart
[03:04.990]With love for a postmark and then..
[03:09.900]You know that you make me feel like we've been caught
[03:14.840]Like kids in the school yard again
[03:18.770]And I can't keep it to myself
[03:23.160]Can't spell it any better
[03:25.500]L.O.V.E forever
[03:28.729]I hope you know that I'm sending a postcard
[03:33.880]I don't care who sees what I sent
[03:38.200]Or if the whole world knows what's in my head
[03:42.300]know, know, know
[03:49.180]All the things I want you to
[03:52.190]know, know, know
[03:58.350]All the things I want you to
[04:01.530]know, know, know
[04:08.200]All the things I want you to
[04:10.880]know, know, know
[04:18.100]All the things I want you to
[04:21.000]know, know, know
[04:26.530]All the things I want you to
[04:29.980]know, know, know
[04:36.900]All the things I want you to
