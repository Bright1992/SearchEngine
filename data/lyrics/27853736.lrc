[00:03.890]Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
[00:07.500]I feel my load is blue, come closer
[00:11.269]I want your energy, I want your aura
[00:15.900]You are my destiny, my mantra
[00:19.270]Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
[00:23.700]Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
[00:26.889]Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)
[00:34.200]Take me down to the river
[00:36.840]Underneath the blood on sun
[00:40.340]Say my name like a scripture
[00:44.270]Keep my heart beating like a drum
[00:48.310]Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
[00:53.870]Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
[01:04.690]Go down in history
[01:06.280]Go down together, into infinity, forever
[01:12.600]Your cleopatra Your blushing Juliet
[01:14.400]You blushing to the end
[01:16.100]Anything for your love, a ride or die
[01:19.530]Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
[01:24.600]Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
[01:27.910]Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)
