[00:08.278]You said I text
[00:11.499]It's like the wind changed your mind
[00:15.289]We were best friends
[00:20.590]Yeah, we were burning our lives
[00:22.289]With every kiss, and every letter
[00:25.739]Every promise of forever, oh
[00:30.879]But you hit send
[00:33.706]And disappeared in front of my eyes
[00:37.280]And now you’re just a ghost
[00:42.290]When I look back never would have known that
[00:44.897]You could be so cold
[00:49.980]Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
[00:53.180]There's just an echo where your heart used to be
[00:56.870]Now I see it clearly
[01:00.070]And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
[01:03.718]My vision's 20/20
[01:06.737]I see through you now
[01:10.490]Something is tight
[01:12.880]Now that I have made up my mind
[01:18.289]I'll be alright
[01:20.970]It doesn't harm me at night
[01:24.390]'Cause every gift, every letter, every promise of forever
[01:30.897]Now, it's out of sight
[01:35.968]Like you were never alive
[01:39.800]And now you’re just a ghost
[01:44.590]When I look back never would have known that
[01:47.890]You could be so cold
[01:51.780]Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
[01:54.897]There's just an echo where your heart used to be
[01:58.398]Now I see it clearly
[02:02.779]And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
[02:05.838]My vision's 20/20
[02:09.779]I see through you now
[02:13.797]Now, now, now, now, now
[02:18.797]So rest in piece
[02:22.780]I see you on the other side
[02:31.889]And now you’re just a ghost
[02:35.780]When I look back never would have known that
[02:38.828]You could be so cold
[02:43.788]Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
[02:46.177]There's just an echo where your heart used to be
[02:50.598]Now I see it clearly
[02:53.837]And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
[02:59.170]My vision's 20/20
[03:01.498]I see through you now
[03:05.318]Now, now, now, now, now
[03:08.560]I see through you now
[03:13.328]Now, now, now, now, now
[03:17.598]I see through you now
