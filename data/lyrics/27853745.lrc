[00:15.890]Can you tell me, who called the race?
[00:22.850]Can anyone stay in one place?
[00:26.870]And when you get to the finish line
[00:31.600]Will you wish for more time?
[00:33.180]I say one day
[00:37.000]One day you will
[00:39.430]But maybe one day you will find
[00:44.150]That you just can't push rewind
[00:49.390]All we have is this moment
[00:53.700]Tomorrow's unspoken
[00:57.530]Yesterday is history
[01:01.500]So why don't you be here with me?
[01:06.430]All we have is this moment
[01:10.420]To put our love into motion
[01:14.670]Yesterday is history
[01:18.500]So why don't you be here with me?
[01:23.440]Be here with me now
[01:28.130]Do you ever think that, we're just chasing our tails?
[01:34.770]Like life is one big fast treadmill
[01:39.100]And we pop what is prescribed
[01:43.360]If it gets us first prize
[01:45.429]But you know who I, who I think will win
[01:52.700]Are the ones that love loving
[01:56.120]Are the ones that take the time
[02:01.510]All we have is this moment
[02:05.900]Tomorrow's unspoken
[02:09.960]Yesterday is history
[02:13.549]So why don't you be here with me?
[02:18.650]All we have is this moment
[02:22.310]To put our love into motion
[02:26.880]Yesterday is history
[02:30.179]So why don't you be here with me?
[02:35.660]Be here with me now
[02:40.240]Be here with me now
[02:45.260]'Cause refuge check is right now, right in front on you
[02:49.799]Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
[02:54.400]Refuge check is right now, I'm in front of you
[02:58.520]Baby don't blink and miss
[03:01.530]This moment
[03:05.620]Tomorrow's unspoken
[03:09.500]Yesterday is history
[03:12.829]So why don't you be here with me?
[03:17.970]All we have is this moment
[03:21.920]To put our love into motion
[03:26.340]Yesterday is history
[03:29.950]So why don't you be here with me?
[03:35.170]Be here with me now
