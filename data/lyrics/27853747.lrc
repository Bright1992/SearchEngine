[00:12.559]Was 27 surviving my return to Saturn
[00:18.480]A long vacation didn't sound so bad
[00:24.270]Was full of secrets locked up tight like iron mountain
[00:30.150]Running on empty sweat of gas
[00:36.770]Thought I wasn't enough
[00:39.120]Found I wasn't so tough
[00:43.160]Laying on the bathroom floor
[00:47.760]We were living on the falling line
[00:50.740]And I felt the fault was all mine
[00:53.740]Couldn't take it anymore
[00:59.500]By the grace of God (there was no other way
[01:04.920]I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay
[01:10.740]I put one foot in front of the other and
[01:17.480]I looked in the mirror and decided to stay
[01:23.500]Wasn't gonna let love take me out the way
[01:35.630]I thanked my sister for keeping my head above the water
[01:41.410]When the truth was like swallowing sand
[01:47.270]Now every morning, oh there is no more mourning
[01:52.000]Oh I can finally see myself again
[01:59.220]I know I am enough
[02:02.100]Possible to be loved
[02:06.460]It was not about me
[02:10.930]Now I have to rise above
[02:13.870]Let the universe call my bluff
[02:17.569]Yeah the truth will set you free
[02:22.599]By the grace of God (there was no other way
[02:27.949]I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay
[02:33.710]I put one foot in front of the other and
[02:40.099]I looked in the mirror and decided to stay
[02:46.190]Wasn't gonna let love take me out of the way
[02:51.620]That way, no, not in the name
[03:00.639]In the name of love
[03:03.129]That way, no, I am not giving up
[03:18.400]By the grace of God
[03:23.789]I picked myself back up
[03:29.599]I put one foot in front of the other and
[03:35.889]I looked in the mirror, looked in the mirror
[03:41.909]By the grace of God (there was no other way
[03:47.420]I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay
[03:53.259]I put one foot in front of the other and
[03:59.720]I looked in the mirror and decided to stay
[04:05.789]Wasn't gonna let love take me out the way
[04:17.430]
