[00:05.200]Is Mercury in retrograde or is that the excuse that I've always made
[00:14.590]'Cause I wanna blame you,
[00:17.810]But I can only blame myself
[00:24.200]Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
[00:29.680]I'll call you crazy, while I'm filling my cup
[00:34.320]I say these things to hurt you
[00:37.890]But I only hurt myself
[00:44.210]Oh, I can only take responsability for me
[00:52.920]It takes two, two sides to every story
[00:58.140]Not just you
[01:00.500]I can't keep ignoring
[01:03.990]I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah
[01:13.100]It takes two, two sides to every story
[01:18.300]Not just me
[01:20.340]You can't keep ignoring
[01:24.900]But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry"
[01:33.479]I face my demons, yeah, I paid my dues
[01:38.479]I had to grow up, I wish you could too
[01:43.500]I wanted to save you, but I can only save myself
[01:53.160]Oh, I can only be the changing one to see
[01:58.640]Yeah, I can see
[02:01.580]It takes two, two sides to every story
[02:06.560]Not just you
[02:09.109]I can't keep ignoring
[02:12.749]I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah
[02:21.630]It takes two, two sides to every story
[02:26.559]Not just me
[02:29.140]You can't keep ignoring
[02:32.629]But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry"
[02:43.190]I point my finger but it does me no good
[02:47.700]I look in the mirror and it tells me truth, yeah
[02:52.910]Why all these lessons always learned the hard way
[02:57.859]Is it too late to change
[03:01.869]It takes two, two sides to every story
[03:06.940]Not just you
[03:09.359]I can't keep ignoring
[03:12.910]I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh
[03:21.519]It takes two, two sides to every story
[03:26.870]Not just me
[03:29.299]You can't keep ignoring
[03:32.880]But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry"
