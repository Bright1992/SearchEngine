[00:01.67]Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one
[00:05.92]
[00:06.85]Love is a tangle and I'm not the only one
[00:11.97]
[00:12.92]Everyone grows old and I'm not the only one
[00:17.97]
[00:20.02]Then why the hell am I still feeling so alone?
[00:23.32]
[00:25.38]Once again, I'm at a crossroads
[00:32.71]
[00:37.52]Wondering which way I should go
[00:41.33]
[00:43.26]If I go, will it take me home?
[00:47.82]
[00:49.26]In my heart, I know…
[00:53.87]
[00:55.06]Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one
[00:59.93]
[01:00.80]Love is a tangle and I'm not the only one
[01:05.97]
[01:06.86]Everyone grows old. I'm not the only one
[01:11.90]
[01:13.91]Then why the hell am I still feeling so alone?
[01:17.09]
[01:19.21]Once again, I'm hanging by a thread
[01:27.25]
[01:31.56]Wondering if I should have my eyes closed
[01:35.37]
[01:37.68]Before I cut my safety rope
[01:42.40]
[01:43.47]In my heart, I know…
[01:47.84]
[01:49.02]Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one
[01:53.95]
[01:54.83]Love is a tangle and I'm not the only one
[02:00.01]
[02:00.88]Everyone grows old and I'm not the only one…
[02:06.56]
[02:08.05]Then why the hell am I still feeling so…
[02:11.29]How am I still feeling so…
[02:14.22]Why the hell am I still feeling so…alone?
[02:18.03]
[02:22.27]Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one
[02:27.45]
[02:28.32]Love is a tangle. I'm not the only one
[02:33.51]
[02:34.32]Everybody wants to have someone to hold
[02:38.99]
[02:41.37]Then why the hell am I still feeling so…
[02:44.62]How am I still feeling so…
[02:47.67]Why the hell am I still feeling so…alone?
[02:51.10]
[02:52.29]Life is a struggle…
[02:54.79]
[02:58.40]Love is a tangle…
[03:00.90]
[03:04.34]Everyone grows old and I'm not the only one
[03:09.88]
[03:14.37]Then why the hell am I still… alone
