[00:08.26]When was the last time you said these words
[00:14.28]To the ones you deeply care for,

[00:35.99]I have a mother; she was a very strict mother
[00:42.79]And I was a rebel, made her life a living hell
[00:48.80]But I'm not like that anymore
[00:52.04]I want to make her smile
[00:55.31]So I'd like to take this moment and say the words

[02:01.10]But how come I haven't told them
[02:04.44]how much they mean to me
[02:07.64]Is it because of the society restraining us from being free ?
[02:14.70]So I'd like to take this moment and say the words
[02:20.90]I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU…
[02:34.64]I have my ex-boyfriends; we don't talk anymore
[02:42.41]But I never stop wishing them, happiness and joy

[02:52.25]and made me who I am today

[03:20.96]She's a 7 year old domestic cat
[03:23.59]pretending she is me
[03:25.70]But she always cheers me up
[03:29.00]when I look into her pretty eyes
[03:33.56]So I'd like to take this moment and say the words

[04:10.19]but some of them will never be heard
[04:13.49]So I'd like to take this moment and say the words
[04:20.09]I THANK YOU, I THANK YOU, I THANK YOU,
[04:30.02]I THANK YOU…

[04:33.76]So this is near the end of the song
[04:37.60]I hope you feel the love
[04:39.62]It's not the typical song I write
[04:43.32]but it's coming from the heart
[04:46.21]If you haven't said these words
[04:50.24]then what the hell are you waiting for ?
[04:53.75]Because it never hurts to say these words !
