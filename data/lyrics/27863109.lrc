Hot and dangerous 
If you're one of us, then roll with us 
'Cause we make the hipsters fall in love 
When we got our hot pants on and up 
And yes, of course we does 
We runnin' this town just like a club 
And no, you don't wanna mess with us 
Got Jesus on my necklaces-es-es 
Got that glitter on my eyes 
Stockings ripped all up the side 
Looking sick and sexified 
So let's go-o-o 
Let's go! 
Tonight we're going har-har-har-ha-ha-hard 
Just like the world is our-our-our-ou-ou-ours 
We're tearin' it apar-par-par-pa-pa-part 
You know we're superstars 
We are who we are! 
We're dancing like we're dum-dum-du-du-du-dumb 
Our bodies growin' num-num-nu-nu-nu-numb 
We'll be forever youn-youn-yo-yo-yo-young 
You know we're superstars 
We are who we are! 
DJ, turn it up 
It's about damn time to live it up 
I'm so sick of being so serious 
It's making my brain delirious 
I'm just talkin' truth 
I'm telling you 'bout the shit we do 
We're sellin' our clothes, sleepin' in cars 
Dressin' it down, hittin' on dudes, hard 
Got that glitter on my eyes 
Stockings ripped all up the side 
Looking sick and sexified 
So let's go-o-o 
Let's go! 
Tonight we're going har-har-har-ha-ha-hard 
Just like the world is our-our-our-ou-ou-ours 
We're tearin' it apar-par-par-pa-pa-part 
You know we're superstars 
We are who we are! 
We're dancing like we're dum-dum-du-du-du-dumb 
Our bodies growin' num-num-nu-nu-nu-numb 
We'll be forever youn-youn-yo-yo-yo-young 
You know we're superstars 
We are who we are! 
DJ, turn it up...
