[00:16.200]I've seen the world
[00:18.170]Done it all, had my cake now
[00:24.280]Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now
[00:32.090]Hot summer nights, mid-July
[00:36.610]When you and I were forever wild
[00:40.600]The crazy days, the city lights
[00:44.570]The way you'd play with me like a child
[00:50.200]Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful
[00:58.390]Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul
[01:05.430]I know you will, I know you will
[01:09.370]I know that you will
[01:13.260]Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful
[01:22.150]I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
[01:30.220]Channeling angels in the new age now
[01:38.090]Hot summer days, rock and roll
[01:42.550]The way you'd play for me at your show
[01:46.780]And all the ways I got to know
[01:50.700]Your pretty face and electric soul
[01:56.420]Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful
[02:04.590]Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul
[02:12.430]I know you will, I know you will
[02:16.400]I know that you will
[02:20.350]Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful
[02:29.770]Dear lord when I get to heaven
[02:33.780]Please let me bring my man
[02:37.880]When he comes tell me that you'll let me
[02:42.000]Father tell me if you can
[02:45.800]Oh that grace, oh that body
[02:49.740]Oh that face makes me wanna party
[02:54.010]He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds
[03:03.230]Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful
[03:11.440]Will you still love me when I got nothiyg but my aching soul
[03:18.600]I know you will, I know you will
[03:22.660]I know that you will
[03:26.730]Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful
