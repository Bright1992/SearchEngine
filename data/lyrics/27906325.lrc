[00:00.000]Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
[00:03.270]I’ll be right there for you
[00:05.960]Tell me what to say, don’t matter if it’s true
[00:09.150]I’ll say it all for you
[00:11.890]I used to be the type of kid would always think the sky is falling
[00:17.320]
[00:17.420]Why am I so differently wired ? Am I a martian ?
[00:20.560]What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
[00:23.700]Because I belong in this world
[00:25.390]That’s why I’m scoffing at authority, defying often
[00:28.030]Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
[00:31.120]So I’m non complying at home, at school I’m just shy and awkward
[00:35.000]
[00:35.060]And no I don’t need no goddamn psychologist
[00:37.850]Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
[00:40.850]
[00:40.950]Thinking he can try and solve them
[00:42.750]I’m outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
[00:45.440]And in the front drive talking to myself
[00:47.700]Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
[00:51.500]
[00:51.600]Trying not to be noticed because I’m crying and sobbing
[00:54.450]I had a bad day at school so I ain’t talking
[00:57.080]Some cocksucker shoved me into a fvcking locker
[00:59.170]Because he said I eyeballed him
[01:01.650]And if you fall, ill get you there
[01:07.380]I’ll be your savior from all the wars that are fought inside your world
[01:17.500]
[01:17.600]Please have faith in my words
[01:20.530]Because… This is my legacy, legacy ehhhhh
[01:29.330]This is my legacy, legacy ehhhhh
[01:35.230]There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me looking overseas
[01:40.290]This is my legacy, legacy legacy, legacy
[01:46.700]I used to be the type of kid would always think the sky is falling
[01:51.000]
[01:51.050]Why am I so differently wired? Am I a Nogging?
[01:54.140]‘Cuz sporadic as my thoughts come, it’s mind boggling
[01:57.130]‘Cuz I obsess on everything and my mind it’s small shit
[02:00.260]Bothers me but now my father, he said Sayonara, then split but I don’t give a shit.
[02:04.680]
[02:04.780]I’m fine along as theirs batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
[02:09.110]
[02:09.210]Shit look at the bright side at least I ain’t walking
[02:11.610]I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment complex on a ten speed which
[02:16.350]
[02:16.350]
[02:16.450]I’ve acquired parts I found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it,
[02:20.330]
[02:20.430]Headphones on straight ahead and kids try to start shit,
[02:23.420]But if this all there is for me Life offers
[02:26.200]Why bother even try and put up a fight It's nonsense
[02:28.860]But i think a lightbulb just lit up in my conscience
[02:32.140]What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
[02:34.180]They are kinda giving me confidence
[02:35.950]Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
[02:37.390]Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
[02:40.390]To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
[02:43.570]
[02:43.670]Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
[02:46.660]
[02:46.760]Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
[02:49.540]Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
[02:52.380]
[02:52.480]I could be iconic, and my conquest is
[02:55.330]Word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest ...

[03:27.660]Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
[03:30.250]Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
[03:32.840]And use my enemy's words as strength
[03:35.280]To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
[03:38.020]Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
[03:41.010]By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
