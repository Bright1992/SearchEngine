[00:01.450]I can feel the heat rising
[00:03.190]Everything is on fire
[00:05.810]Today is a painful reminder of why
[00:11.670]We can only get brighter
[00:14.120]The further you put it behind ya
[00:17.480]And right now I'm on the inside
[00:21.220]Lookin out, cause
[00:21.910]I found her in the flames
[00:26.460]There's a beautiful kind of pain
[00:29.340]Setting fire to yesterday
[00:32.330]Find the light, find the light, find the light
[00:34.820]I found her in the flames
[00:38.010]There's a beautiful kind of pain
[00:40.940]Setting fire to yesterday
[00:43.930]Find the light, find the light, find the light
[00:45.680]Yesterday was the tornado warning,
[00:46.930]today is like the morning after
[00:48.620]Your world is torn in half, you wake
[00:50.440]and let's wait to start the morning process
[00:52.170]Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
[00:54.300]Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
[00:57.100]The thunderstorm has passed ya,
[00:58.970]your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
[01:01.850]Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your noses
[01:04.670]So focused on the brightside,
[01:06.970]then you floor the gas pedal,
[01:08.290]and hit the corner fast, the more asserted,
[01:10.720]never looking back, may hit the curb,
[01:12.280]but everyday is a new learning curve, as you,
[01:14.150]steer through life,
[01:15.090]sometimes you might not wanna swerve,
[01:16.210]but you have to,
[01:16.960]to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage,
[01:19.700]cause they hurt you so bad,
[01:21.200]it's like they murdered your ass,
[01:22.580]and threw dirt on your casket,
[01:24.010]but you returned from the ashes,
[01:25.580]and that hurt that you have,
[01:27.010]you just converted to gasoline,
[01:28.380]and while you're burning the past,
[01:29.750]standing at inferno and chant
[01:31.500]I found her in the flames
[01:34.180]
[01:36.120]There's a beautiful kind of pain
[01:38.110]
[01:38.990]Setting fire to yesterday
[01:40.610]
[01:41.920]Find the light, find the light, find the light
[01:44.480]I found her in the flames
[01:45.970]
[01:47.350]There's a beautiful kind of pain
[01:49.470]
[01:50.540]Setting fire to yesterday
[01:52.280]
[01:53.520]Find the light, find the light, find the light
[01:55.520]So familiarize what having to swallow this pill is like
[01:58.210]It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
[02:01.010]And it's as though you feel you've died
[02:02.570]because you've been killed inside
[02:03.880]But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
[02:07.200]Although today you may weep because you're weak and
[02:09.440]Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
[02:10.930]The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
[02:13.750]That's the only thing keepin
[02:15.120]you from leapin off the motherfreaking deep end
[02:17.720]
[02:18.780]And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
[02:20.650]And with a little time that should do the healin
[02:23.210]And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
[02:25.580]To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
[02:28.260]This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
[02:30.640]Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
[02:32.950]But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
[02:34.790]And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin and you look down
[02:37.850]Cause you're so over them
[02:39.040]you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin
[02:41.220]As time passes, things change everyday
[02:44.090]But wounds wounds heal
[02:45.530]But scars still remaining the same
[02:47.340]
[02:48.030]But to today's gone down in flames
[02:50.080]
[02:51.560]Throw the match at the place
[02:53.810]So feel the fire beneath your feet
[02:55.310]As you barely even perspire from the heat
[02:57.250]Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
[02:58.990]And as you say goodbye to the grief
[03:00.670]It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
[03:02.920]But you've extinguished this living hell
[03:04.540]Still a little piece of you dies, you scream
[03:07.420]I found her in the flames
[03:11.790]There's a beautiful kind of pain
[03:14.650]Setting fire to yesterday
[03:17.590]Find the light, find the light, find the light
[03:20.210]I found her in the flames
[03:23.070]There's a beautiful kind of pain
[03:26.260]Setting fire to yesterday
[03:29.190]Find the light, find the light, find the light
[03:31.630]Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
[03:39.140]Rising, a phoenix from the flames
[03:52.890]With wings I will fly
[03:56.570]I found her in the flames
[04:01.130]There's a beautiful kind of pain
[04:03.990]Setting fire to yesterday
[04:06.930]Find the light, find the light, find the light
[04:09.550]I found her in the flames
[04:12.420]There's a beautiful kind of pain
[04:15.660]Setting fire to yesterday
[04:18.540]Find the light, find the light, find the light
