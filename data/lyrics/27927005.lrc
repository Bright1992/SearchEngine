[00:16.100]Come to me, in all your glamour, and cruelty
[00:22.680]Just do that thing that you do
[00:27.970]And I'll undress you
[00:32.570]Give it time, sometimes the simplest move is right
[00:39.110]The melody that you choose
[00:44.390]Can rescue you?
[00:50.530]A hybrid can withstand these things
[00:54.430]My heart can beat with bricks and strings
[00:58.530]My artpop could mean anything
[01:06.880]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[01:10.950]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[01:14.580]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[01:19.140]ARTPOP, ARTPOP
[01:28.790]Come to me, without a sub-tech and fantasy
[01:35.480]Just do that thing that you do
[01:40.820]For my love is you
[01:45.220]Love is fly, I've flown my beaches with lover's side
[01:51.840]Look at the better you choose
[01:57.120]And profit you
[02:03.150]A hybrid can withstand these things
[02:07.230]My heart can beat with bricks and strings
[02:11.229]My artpop could mean anything
[02:20.390]Could try to sell you out or I
[02:23.990]Could show all the reasons why my artpop could mean anything
[02:37.849]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[02:41.840]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[02:45.849]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[02:49.879]ARTPOP, ARTPOP
[02:54.030]Brushing your darkness won't help you create your destiny of super
[02:59.259]Artpop could mean anything
[03:03.090]Anything
[03:09.909]I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing
[03:13.930]Because I just love the music not the bling
[03:19.900]Music not the bling
[03:25.890]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[03:29.850]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[03:33.929]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[03:38.890]ARTPOP, ARTPOP
[03:42.279]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[03:46.320]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[03:50.309]We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
[03:54.410]ARTPOP, ARTPOP
[03:59.189]Free my mind, ARTPOP
[04:03.569]You make my heart stop
