[00:17.340]Corks off, it's on
[00:21.830]The party's just begun
[00:24.800]I promise this
[00:28.800]This drink is my last one
[00:31.798]I know that I fucked up again
[00:35.738]Because I lost my only friend
[00:39.789]God forgive my sins
[00:45.789]Don't leave me, I
[00:54.128]Oh I will hate myself until I die
[01:00.948]My heart would break without you
[01:05.738]Might not awake without you
[01:09.589]Been hurting low, from living high for so long
[01:16.538]I'm sorry, and I love you
[01:20.378]Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
[01:23.558]I'll keep searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope
[01:32.498]I need you more than dope
[01:36.797]Need you more than dope
[01:39.948]Need you more than dope
[01:43.478]I need you more than dope
[01:51.190]Toast one last puff
[01:54.598]And two last regrets
[01:57.718]Three spirits and
[02:02.248]Twelve lonely steps
[02:04.848]Up heaven's stairway to gold
[02:10.100]Mine myself like coal
[02:13.060]A mountain of a soul
[02:19.640]Each day, I cry
[02:26.600]Oh, I feel so low from living high
[02:33.580]My heart would break without you
[02:37.110]Might not awake without you
[02:40.650]Been hurting low, from living high for so long
[02:48.020]I'm sorry, and I love you
[02:51.560]Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
[02:55.140]I'll keep searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope
[03:03.710]I need you more than dope
[03:07.290]Need you more than dope
[03:11.600]Need you more than dope
[03:14.560]I need you more than dope
[03:19.640]I need you more
[03:22.820]Need you more
[03:27.750]I need you more than dope
