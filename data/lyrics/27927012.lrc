[00:00.380]Sometimes a story has no end
[00:03.830]Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
[00:08.080]'Cuz I'm wanderin' man, he said to me:
[00:14.700]And what about our future plans?
[00:18.180]Does this thing we have even make sense?
[00:22.410]When I got the whole world in front of me
[00:27.210]So I said:
[00:28.780]I don't wanna be alone forever
[00:31.730]But I can be tonight
[00:35.790]I don't wanna be alone forever
[00:38.980]But I love Gypsy life
[00:43.040]I don't wanna be alone forever
[00:46.730]Maybe we could see the world together
[00:50.250]I don't wanna be alone forever
[00:53.410]But I can be
[00:56.730]tonight
[01:11.820]So I just packed my baggage and
[01:15.460]Said goodbye to family and friends
[01:19.580]And took a road to nowhere on my own
[01:26.260]Like Dorothy on the yellow brick
[01:29.820]Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
[01:33.900]'Cuz I left everyone I love at home
[01:40.290]And I don't wanna be alone forever
[01:43.410]But I can be tonight
[01:47.600]I don't wanna be alone forever
[01:50.610]But I love Gypsy life
[01:54.850]I don't wanna be alone forever
[01:58.180]Maybe we could see the world together
[02:01.670]I don't wanna be alone forever
[02:04.930]But I can be
[02:08.180]tonight tonight
[02:22.670]'Cuz I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
[02:24.820]A Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, I'm
[02:26.640]I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
[02:28.430]A Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, I'm
[02:30.280]I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
[02:32.000]A Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, I'm
[02:33.870]I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
[02:35.430]A Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, I'm
[02:39.610]And then he asked me, he said baby,
[02:42.640]why do we love each other?
[02:46.350]I said, honey, it's simple
[02:48.490]It's the way that you love and treat your mother
[02:52.050]Thought that I would be alone forever
[02:55.120]But I won't be tonight
[02:59.240]I'm a man without a home
[03:01.050]But I think with you I can spend my life
[03:06.300]And you'll be my little Gypsy princess
[03:09.940]Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
[03:13.500]Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
[03:16.470]'Cuz it's you and me
[03:20.740]Baby for life
[03:26.310](If you go with me)
[03:28.750]For life
[03:33.360](See the world with me)
[03:36.250]'Cuz I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
[03:38.250]A Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, I'm
[03:40.130]I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
[03:41.720]A Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, I'm
[03:43.680]Russian, UK, Paris, I'm
[03:45.430]Italian, Asian Kompai
[03:47.120]African, India, I'm
[03:49.020]A Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, I'm
[03:50.750]Latin-American, I
[03:52.590]don't speak German but I try
[03:54.350]Someday, in Jakarta, I'm American,
[03:57.050]I'm Gypsy, I
[03:58.000]Bangkok, Australia, Malaysia,
[03:59.690]Sweden, Finland, Norway
[04:01.570]Be my home just for the day
[04:03.220]I'm a Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, hey!
