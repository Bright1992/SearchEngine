[00:00.000]Oh misty eye of the Mountain below,
[00:07.460]Keep careful watch of my brothers’ souls,
[00:15.440]And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke,
[00:24.270]Keep watching over Durin’s sons.
[00:44.360]If this is to end in fire,
[00:47.690]Then we shall all burn together,
[00:50.790]Watch the flames climb higher,
[00:53.880]Into the night.
[00:57.110]Calling out father oh,
[01:00.440]Stand by and we will,
[01:03.730]Watch the flames burn on and on,
[01:06.960]The mountainside,
[01:15.590]And if we should die tonight,
[01:19.300]We should all die together.
[01:22.370]Raise a glass of wine,
[01:25.460]For the last time.
[01:28.890]Calling out father oh,
[01:32.110]Prepare as we will,
[01:35.150]Watch the flames burn on and on,
[01:38.530]The mountainside.
[01:41.140]Desolation comes upon the sky.
[01:47.300]Now I see fire,
[01:50.720]Inside the mountain.
[01:54.010]I see fire,
[01:56.610]Burning the trees.
[01:59.810]And I see fire,
[02:03.600]Hollowing souls.
[02:06.270]I see fire,
[02:09.950]Blood in the breeze.
[02:12.940]And I’ll hope that you’ll remember me.
[02:28.280]Oh should my people fall then,
[02:32.230]Surely I’ll do the same.
[02:35.700]Confined in mountain halls,
[02:39.190]We got too close to the flame.
[02:42.020]Calling out father oh,
[02:45.690]Hold fast and we will,
[02:48.850]Watch the flames burn on and on,
[02:52.210]The mountainside.
[02:55.110]Desolation comes upon the sky.
[03:01.130]Now I see fire,
[03:04.980]Inside the mountain.
[03:07.560]I see fire,
[03:10.860]Burning the trees.
[03:13.930]And I see fire,
[03:17.480]Hollowing souls.
[03:20.190]I see fire,
[03:24.090]Blood in the breeze.
[03:27.500]And I’ll hope that you’ll remember me.
[03:33.300]And if the night is burning,
[03:37.140]I will cover my eyes,
[03:39.820]For if the dark returns,
[03:43.040]Then my brothers will die.
[03:45.910]And as the sky is falling down,
[03:49.490]It crashed into this lonely town.
[03:52.290]And with that shadow upon the ground,
[03:55.560]I hear my people screaming out.
[03:58.560]I see fire,
[04:02.780]Inside the mountains.
[04:05.400]I see fire,
[04:08.820]Burning the trees.
[04:11.690]I see fire,
[04:15.410]Hollowing souls.
[04:17.800]I see fire,
[04:21.820]Blood in the breeze.
[04:23.900]I see fire,
[04:26.380](Oh you know I saw a city burning.)
[04:30.700](Fire.)I see fire
[04:32.360](Feel the heat upon my skin.)
[04:34.650]Fire.
[04:36.380]And I see fire,
[04:40.720]Fire.
[04:43.030]And I see fire burn on and on,
[04:46.750]The mountainside.
