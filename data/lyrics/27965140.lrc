[00:12.470]And another one bites the dust
[00:16.740]But why can I not conquer love?
[00:20.080]And I might’ve got to be with one
[00:23.510]Why not fight this war without weapons
[00:27.320]And I want it and I want everything
[00:31.740]But there was so many red flags
[00:34.890]Now another one bites the dust
[00:38.840]And let’s be clear, I trust no one
[00:41.980]You cannot break me
[00:49.170]I’m still fighting for this
[00:55.870]Well I’ve got a thick skin and an elastic heart
[01:01.030]But yours baby might get too sharp
[01:03.370]I’m like the weather burning, baby I’m too hard
[01:08.560]But I missed him and I move close
[01:10.350]But you won’t see me move no more
[01:17.580]‘Cause I’ve got an elastic heart
[01:25.000]I’ve got an elastic heart
[01:31.860]Yea, I’ve got an elastic heart
[01:41.720]And now I step through the night
[01:45.330]Let’s be clear, won’t close my eyes
[01:49.020]And I know that I can’t survive
[01:52.720]I walked too far to save my life
[01:56.120]And I want it, I want my life so bad
[02:00.060]I’m doing everything I can
[02:03.530]Then another one bites the dust
[02:07.460]It’s hard to lose a chosen one
[02:10.680]You cannot break me
[02:17.500]I’m still fighting for this
[02:24.470]Well I’ve got a thick skin and an elastic heart
[02:29.570]But yours baby might get too sharp
[02:31.930]I’m like the weather burning, baby I’m too hard
[02:37.100]But I missed him and I move close
[02:39.620]But you won’t see me move no more
[02:46.250]‘Cause I’ve got an elastic heart
[03:08.610]Well I’ve got a thick skin and an elastic heart
[03:13.760]But yours baby might get too sharp
[03:16.210]I’m like the weather burning, baby I’m too hard
[03:21.510]But I missed him and I move close
[03:24.160]But you won’t see me move no more
[03:30.370]‘Cause I’ve got an elastic heart (Chorus)
[03:53.230]You won’t see me move no more
[04:00.350]‘Cause I’ve got an elastic heart
[04:07.950]I’ve got an elastic heart
