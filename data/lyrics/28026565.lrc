[00:00.50]Sooner or later that spark just disappears
[00:04.68]Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
[00:10.64]Every time one of us ending up in tears
[00:14.71]Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
[00:20.09]Is it good that we hurt every day?
[00:23.98]It this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
[00:30.18]Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
[00:35.04]Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
[00:41.29]I live the fast life, going nowhere fast
[00:43.66]I see my past life and politely pass
[00:46.83]But I’m already planning on doing it big
[00:48.29]For my life after death, I live my life after death
[00:51.52]Baby what you think our train is for?
[00:54.25]That’s to properly prepare you for war
[00:56.90]So I keep you on your toes
[00:58.68]So you could look out for your friends that are really foes
[01:02.05]This career try to swallow us
[01:04.63]Paparazzi try to follow us
[01:07.04]I’m everything that my mama was
[01:08.77]Rider, survivor, a motherfuckin fighter
[01:12.27]Thank god for this rapping shit
[01:14.59]Forget the cash if I’d happen this
[01:17.14]No more life, that’s for the birds
[01:18.99]I work hard so you never say these words
[01:21.31]Sooner or later that spark just disappears
[01:25.50]Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
[01:31.45]Every time one of us ending up in tears
[01:35.53]Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
[01:40.87]Is it good that we hurt every day?
[01:44.78]It this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
[01:50.99]Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
[01:55.83]Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
[02:02.29]The critics going nowhere (nowhere)
[02:04.31]Thinking that they know me like the Bible, oh hell no
[02:07.41]But they don’t understand me all well
[02:09.52]Snitching is a sport now so please do tell
[02:12.97]The world how I raise hell
[02:15.04]Yea, so the clown when I skip jail
[02:17.58]I’m just tryina own teams, beat it playa
[02:19.84]And dance on the globe like Fred Astaire
[02:22.50]The world is ours baby
[02:24.53]It’s just waiting for us so don’t be late
[02:27.55]And we could both aim for the sky
[02:29.57]And shoot for the stars and call it a day
[02:32.51]Now you know that I know that we know
[02:34.73]If the world wants war cock back and reload
[02:37.90]A normal life, that’s for the birds
[02:40.19]I work hard, so you never say these words
[02:42.66]Sooner or later that spark just disappears
[02:46.39]Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
[02:52.30]Every time one of us ending up in tears
[02:56.37]Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
[03:01.72]Is it good that we hurt every day?
[03:05.59]It this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
[03:11.79]Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
[03:16.64]Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
