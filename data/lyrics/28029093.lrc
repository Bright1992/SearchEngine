[00:21.930]It's late in the evening
[00:25.480]
[00:27.080]she's wondering what clothes to wear
[00:32.140]She puts on her make-up
[00:35.300]
[00:37.150]and brushes her long blonde hair
[00:40.960]
[00:42.510]And then she asks me Do I look all right
[00:50.600]And I say Yes you look wonderful tonight
[00:57.440]
[01:07.690]We go to a party and everyone turns to see
[01:16.490]
[01:17.750]This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
[01:26.650]
[01:28.250]And then she asks me Do you feel all right
[01:36.250]And I say Yes I feel wonderful tonight
[01:42.840]
[01:46.050]I feel wonderful because I see
[01:52.190]The love light in your eyes
[01:55.980]
[01:56.850]And the wonder of it all
[02:00.870]
[02:01.670]Is that you just don't realize how much I love you
[02:09.690]
[02:28.830]It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
[02:37.680]
[02:38.900]So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
[02:47.080]
[02:49.290]And then I tell her as I turn out the light
[02:57.380]I say My darling you were wonderful tonight
[03:04.390]
[03:08.120]Oh my darling you were wonderful tonight
[03:14.450]
