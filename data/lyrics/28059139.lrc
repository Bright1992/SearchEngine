[00:28.580]My girl she ain’t the one that I saw coming
[00:35.160]Sometimes I don’t know which way to go
[00:41.840]And I try to run before but I’m not running anymore

[01:34.050]My boy he ain’t the one that I saw coming
[01:40.610]And some have said his heart’s too hard to hold
[01:47.030]And it takes a little time but you should see him
[01:53.900]Because you never wanna let the feeling go
[01:59.820]When you love who you love who you love
