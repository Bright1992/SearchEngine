[00:00.53]Money cannot buy
[00:04.90]All the love that’s here tonight
[00:08.02]All the love that’s here tonight
[00:11.18]
[00:12.63]It’s just you and I
[00:16.96]So lift your hands toward the sky
[00:20.07]Lift your hands toward the sky
[00:23.10]
[00:24.36][Angel Haze]
[00:26.52]It seems like yesterday that I was nothin’
[00:26.64]Then all of a sudden I’m a volcanic eruption
[00:28.59]Then all of a sudden it’s like spontaneous combustion
[00:29.69]And I’m all up in your face yellin’: “Bitch, you can’t tell me nothin’”
[00:35.81]Cause I came from the bottom, now everybody’s watchin’
[00:38.77]I said it was my time, now I’m who everybody’s glockin’
[00:41.73]And I’m just out here sprintin’, I’m runnin’ right through my vision
[00:44.65]I’m trying to out run my past, but still trying to defeat my limits
[00:47.75]Cause you only get one moment in this life to be great
[00:50.46]And you give it your all despite what it takes
[00:53.67]And you never let ‘em kill you, you take everything they give you
[00:55.98]And throw it right fuckin’ at ‘em and tell ‘em it doesn’t build you
[00:59.32]And no it don’t ever break you, and no it can’t overtake you
[01:02.85]Life’s like a bed of roses, you take the thorns and you make do
[01:05.71]Sometimes you have to hurt for the cause to be reached
[01:08.65]But one day you’ll be stronger then all that you beat
[01:12.00]And you can say
[01:12.45][Sia]
[01:12.51]Money cannot buy
[01:16.87]All the love that’s here tonight
[01:19.99]All the love that’s here tonight
[01:23.01]
[01:24.52]It’s just you and I
[01:28.94]So lift your hands toward the sky
[01:32.05]Lift your hands toward the sky
[01:34.81]
[01:35.91][Angel Haze]
[01:36.37]I woke up one Sunday morning, stopped believing in Jesus
[01:39.33]Stopped believing in churches, I stopped believing in preachers
[01:42.30]I realized I was a teacher, not just one of the heathens
[01:45.12]I’m born to destroy the fallacies, stop creating believers
[01:48.38]Start creating the leaders, tell ‘em who they should follow
[01:51.14]Nobody but themselves, especially if they hollow
[01:54.36]Especially when they empty and death reserves for fulfillment
[01:57.50]You the only person alive who holds the key to your healin’
[02:00.01]So you take it and you run with it
[02:03.17]And keep going even when your suns hidden
[02:06.19]Because the time we spend in darkness when the rain come
[02:09.30]Is where we often find the light soon as the pain’s done
[02:11.97]There ain’t material things in the world
[02:13.92]That can change the fact that you feel lonely
[02:15.46]Despite the fact that it gets hard, you take it all and you still go
[02:18.17]Take the sun and you still grow, lose the light and you still glow
[02:21.54]I been there, I’m still here and I know how you feel, so
[02:23.90][Sia]
[02:24.46]Money cannot buy
[02:28.93]All the love that’s here tonight
[02:31.95]All the love that’s here tonight
[02:34.91]
[02:36.57]It’s just you and I
[02:40.89]So lift your hands toward the sky
[02:43.95]Lift your hands toward the sky
[02:46.97]
[02:48.02][Bridge]
[02:48.62]We don’t wanna fight
[02:52.94]So sing with me our battle cry
[02:55.90]Sing with me our battle cry
[02:59.26]
[03:00.51]Money cannot buy
[03:04.68]All the love that’s here tonight
[03:07.85]All the love that’s here tonight
[03:10.92]
[03:11.93][Angel Haze]
[03:14.98]It’s hard to explain my way of living to people who never lived it
[03:15.28]A minute in my position filled with my opposition
[03:18.10]That anybody not different fighting to stay the same
[03:21.32]I got lives in my hands and I’m fighting to make ‘em change
[03:24.48]Couldn’t accept responsibility, find somebody to blame
[03:27.39]The emotions that I’m harboring ’bout to drive me insane
[03:30.35]Tried to say fuck everything, but I ain’t have the heart to
[03:33.61]Rarely had the heart to do a lot of things I ought to
[03:36.83]So now I spit it for people who say their cords missing
[03:39.58]Inspire life into anybody that’s forfeiting
[03:42.79]Cause it’s easy to keep pretending that there’s nothing wrong
[03:45.95]But it’s harder to keep their head up and be fucking strong
[03:48.82]So, now they telling me “go, Haze, they can’t stop you
[03:51.69]Heavyweight flow, if they can’t lift you then they can’t drop you
[03:54.67]The pinnacle, if they can’t reach you then they can’t top you
[03:57.78]Man, they can’t do anything that you’re about to”
[04:00.54][Sia]
[04:00.84]Money cannot buy
[04:04.91]All the love that’s here tonight
[04:07.93]All the love that’s here tonight
[04:11.00]
[04:12.50]It’s just you and I
[04:16.88]So lift your hands toward the sky
[04:19.95]Lift your hands toward the sky
[04:22.87]
[04:24.57]We don’t wanna fight
[04:29.04]So sing with me our battle cry
[04:31.91]Sing with me our battle cry
[04:34.92]
[04:36.53]Money cannot buy
[04:40.95]All the love that’s here tonight
[04:44.11]All the love that’s here tonight
