[00:21.00]Midnight,lock all the doors
[00:25.45]Keep playing that song one day
[00:30.25]Just the sound of the traffic
[00:33.10]The patron of you switching lanes
[00:41.67]San Diego,hard rock hotel
[00:46.31]Wondering why I came
[00:50.60]I said I'll try not to think of you
[00:54.27]If You say you don't feel the same
[01:02.07]Ooohh,ooohh
[01:12.47]Ohh,you're a reluctant cause you know
[01:15.46]I'll leave you nothing to see
[01:23.16]Ooohh,ooohh
[01:33.02]I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me
[01:44.34]Fells like the end of the world
[01:48.88]Right in this new poor town
[01:53.47]Ohh,I should have kept quiet
[01:56.35]Yeah I should have shut my shupid mouth
[02:05.19]The long table
[02:07.14]The boomerang
[02:09.88]Travelling way down south
[02:14.35]And it's ironic cause
[02:16.19]It's probably the last time that you see me around
[02:24.26]Ooohh,ooohh
[02:35.95]Ohh,youre a reluctant cause you know i'll leave you nothing to see

[02:45.30]Ooohh,ooohh

[03:06.36]I said I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me
