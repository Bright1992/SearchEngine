[00:11.560]I should have told you how
[00:15.960]I really feel a little in advance
[00:21.900]Then I would've had some time to go and work it out
[00:28.740]I think I've lost my chance
[00:32.670]For the last 3 years I just hit it so well
[00:35.200]Hoping that you'd figure it out because I never could tell
[00:37.970]It straight to your face
[00:43.140]And never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
[00:46.130]From a dream wondering if you'll ever say goodbye
[00:50.090]If I didn't say it first
[00:53.710]I’m done playing these games
[00:57.910]I can't believe what I’m about to say
[01:04.160]I won't tell you goodbye
[01:07.420]With my love left behind
[01:09.970]Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind
[01:26.240]No, no more nights
[01:30.210]Drink until my loneliness up till 2 AM
[01:37.980]No, no more waiting pacing round the bar
[01:44.530]Hoping that you might walk in
[01:48.950]For the last 3 years I just hit it so well
[01:51.380]Hoping that you'd figure it out because I never could tell
[01:54.300]It straight to your face
[02:00.120]And never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
[02:03.380]From a dream wondering if you’ll ever say goodbye
[02:06.810]If I didn't say it first
[02:10.440]I'm done playing these games
[02:14.630]I can't believe what I’m about to say
[02:20.690]No I won’t tell you goodbye
[02:23.960]With my love left behind
[02:26.730]Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind
[02:55.780]I'm done playing these games
[03:00.160]I can't believe what I'm about to say
[03:06.660]Cause I would rather die
[03:09.630]Then feeling this inside
[03:12.110]Tricks played on my mind
[03:15.030]No I would rather die than just tell you goodbye
[03:20.330]My love left behind
[03:22.790]Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind
[03:29.460]
