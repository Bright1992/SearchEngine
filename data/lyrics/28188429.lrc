[00:01.500]To get me out , out of crowded universe,
[00:09.020]Universe just got to burst,
[00:13.580]Burst into embers.
[00:19.450]Havoc has recurred.
[00:46.550]If I’m not ,I’m not born with wings and horns,
[00:52.210]To trek in nights and leap the thorns,
[00:56.420]Who will show up in the dawn?
[01:02.720]If I’m not ,I’m not armed with shields and spears,
[01:06.480]To kill thousands with no fear
[01:12.620]Who ll be proudly cheered?
[01:21.000]Pisces, slaked in the skyline,
[01:24.880]Were you still waiting, waiting for next time?
[01:38.010]To pick me out, out of 12 in 88,
[01:44.020]88 lost epic tales,
[01:48.110]Tales about sun rays.
[01:51.820]But only 12 could flame.
[02:04.710]Am I a vagrant, or holy infant?
[02:12.240]Living in my palace, in the nebulae.
[02:21.390]Near the equator, by the ecliptic,
[02:30.020]Star charts are repainted.
[02:39.420]There, the totems are arrayed,
[02:43.590]Directly cross the milky way.
[03:15.810]If I’m not ,I’m not wearing masks of ghost,
[03:21.610]Half vampire, and half angel,
[03:25.790]Am I fallen, who will know?
[03:32.600]If I’m not, I’m not endowed charming look,
[03:37.680]Too glamorous to endure.
[03:41.640]who will be seduced?
[03:48.110]Aries, rose in the midnight,
[03:54.260]Were you still waiting, waiting for last time?
[04:09.660]Get me out , out of crowded universe,
[04:15.620]Universe just got to burst,
[04:19.600]Burst into embers.
[04:23.620]So havoc has recurred.
[04:26.010]Pick me out, out of 12 in 88,
[04:31.300]88 lost epic tales,
[04:35.420]Tales about sun rays.
[04:38.990]But only 12 could flame.
[04:41.630]because I don t have one more life
[04:49.030]For myself to divine.
[04:57.550]Pick me out, out of 12 in 88,
[05:03.150]88 lost epic names,
[05:07.550]Names are doomed to fade.
[05:11.100]But only I remained.
