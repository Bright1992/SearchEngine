[00:08.290]I left a note on my bedpost
[00:10.800]
[00:10.900]Said not to repeat
[00:12.460]Yesterday's mistakes
[00:14.330]What I tend to do
[00:15.910]When it comes to you
[00:17.580]I see only the good
[00:19.610]Selective memory
[00:20.870]The way he makes me feel, yeah
[00:22.740]Gotta hold on me
[00:23.860]I've never met someone so different
[00:26.330]

[01:19.680]Fall off the train
[01:22.280]Land in his bed
[01:23.040]Repeat yesterday's mistakes
[01:24.900]What I'm trying to say is not to forget
[01:28.430]You see only the good, selective memory
[01:31.600]The way he makes me feel like
[01:33.180]The way he makes me feel
