A couple seasons
just passed me by 
since you made me feel so real 
That feeling I remember,it was as good as it can be. 
I haven't seen you for a while, 
I wonder if you are well. 
What's going on in your mind,I really would like to see.  
I try to see but it won't do, 
it's taking time to get near. 
Something is hart to explain 
I wonder can I tell you. 
We haven't been talking much
it doesn't mean I don't care. 
Should I just call you to say 
I'm falling and I miss you. 
oooh hoo
Wish I was with you in my dreams 
and I'm praying to be your side 
and suddenly you'll slip away 
oooh hoo
Easy as flowing down the stream 
Do you know that? 
Will you understand me? 
Why is it you make me wait so long? 
Sometimes do you think of me  

as much as I think of you 
I'd like to know when you dream Am I there? 
Do you miss me? 
I know you can't share life with me 
and I don't know what to do 
but if you walk right thru my door, 
you will see that I miss you 
In my heart 
I want you to know that 
I miss you
