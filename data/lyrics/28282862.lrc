[00:18.32]Eyes make their peace in difficulties
[00:22.82]With wounded lips and salted cheeks
[00:26.07]And finally we step to leave
[00:29.64]To the departure lounge of disbelief
[00:33.36]And I don't know where I'm going
[00:36.54]But I know it's gonna be a long time
[00:41.43]And I'll be leaving in the morning
[00:44.03]Come the white wine bitter sunlight
[00:48.64]Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
[00:55.99]Before the bleeding sun comes alive
[01:03.76]I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
[01:10.98]And hear my beating heart one last time
[01:18.17]Before daylight
[01:27.75]In the canyon underneath the trees
[01:31.63]Behind the dark sky, you looked at me
[01:35.58]I fell for you like autumn leaves
[01:39.60]Never faded, evergreen
[01:43.84]And I don't know where I'm going
[01:45.85]But I know it's gonna be a long time
[01:51.20]'Cause I'll be leaving in the morning
[01:53.41]Come the white wine bitter sunlight
[01:56.41]Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
[02:03.57]Before the bleeding sun comes alive
[02:11.04]I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
[02:18.68]And hear my beating heart one last time
[02:28.44]I can't face this now everything has changed
[02:32.86]I just wanna be by your side, here's hoping we collide
[02:40.45]Here's hoping we collide
[02:47.60]Here's hoping we collide
[02:56.25]Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
[03:03.75]Before the bleeding sun comes alive
[03:11.29]I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
[03:18.69]And hear my beating heart one last time
[03:26.16]Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
[03:31.40]
