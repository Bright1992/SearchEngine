[00:15:500](I) Springtime just reminds me of your blue eyes
[00:20.850]Just like the blue skies overhead
[00:28.200](A) And Summer just reminds me of your warm smile
[00:33.750]Just like the sunshine and the long nights we spent
[00:41.200](B) Cos days turn into weeks
[00:43.500]I watch the seasons change
[00:46.500]But I'm still waiting
[00:49.500]Waiting for this feeling to fade
[00:54.200](D) And weeks turn into months
[00:56.780]My heart disintegrates
[01:00.000]With every thought of you
[01:03.900]I'm still missing you

[01:39.400]And I'm so scared that someone else is holding you
[01:46.000](A) Cos days turn into weeks
[01:51.500][01:48.500]I watch the seasons change
[01:54.200]But I'm still waiting
[01:58.900]Waiting for this feeling to fade
[01:59.200](B) And weeks turn into months
[02:01.500]My heart disintegrates
[02:04.500]With every thought of you
[02:08.500]I'm still missing you
