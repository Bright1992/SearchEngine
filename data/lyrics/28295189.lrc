[00:09.390]What would I do without your smart mouth
[00:12.950]Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
[00:16.560]Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
[00:24.340]What's going on in that beautiful mind
[00:28.140]I'm on your magical mystery ride
[00:32.070]And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
[00:40.430]My head's under water
[00:44.050]But I'm breathing fine
[00:48.130]You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
[00:53.740]'Cause all of me
[00:56.810]Loves all of you
[01:00.620]Love your curves and all your edges
[01:04.490]All your perfect imperfections
[01:08.290]Give your all to me
[01:12.100]I'll give my all to you
[01:15.660]You're my end and my beginning
[01:19.770]Even when I lose I'm winning
[01:23.150]'Cause I give you all, all of me
[01:30.810]And you give me all, all of you, oh
[01:40.610]How many times do I have to tell you
[01:44.220]Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
[01:47.900]The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
[01:55.460]You're my downfall, you're my muse
[01:59.330]My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
[02:03.190]I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
[02:11.860]My head's under water
[02:15.220]But I'm breathing fine
[02:19.490]You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
[02:25.220]'Cause all of me
[02:28.160]Loves all of you
[02:31.780]Love your curves and all your edges
[02:35.840]All your perfect imperfections
[02:39.520]Give your all to me
[02:43.330]I'll give my all to you
[02:47.130]You're my end and my beginning
[02:50.880]Even when I lose I'm winning
[02:54.690]'Cause I give you all of me
[03:02.150]And you give me all, all of you, oh
[03:09.700]Give me all of you
[03:13.200]Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
[03:20.740]Risking it all, though it's hard
[03:26.230]'Cause all of me
[03:29.110]Loves all of you
[03:32.720]Love your curves and all your edges
[03:36.800]All your perfect imperfections
[03:40.540]Give your all to me
[03:44.220]I'll give my all to you
[03:47.960]You're my end and my beginning
[03:51.780]Even when I lose I'm winning
[03:55.520]'Cause I give you all of me
[04:03.270]And you give me all of you
[04:11.070]I give you all, all of me
[04:18.500]And you give me all, all of you, oh
