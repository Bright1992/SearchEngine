[00:12.220] That feeling, that doesnt go away just did
[00:17.830] And I walked a thousand miles to prove it
[00:23.190] And Im caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts
[00:28.930] The color of my blood is all I see on the rocks
[00:33.870] As you sail from me
[00:38.920] Alarms will ring for eternity
[00:44.320] The waves will break every chain on me
[00:49.720] My bones will bleach
[00:52.660] My flesh will flee
[00:55.300] So help my lifeless frame to breathe
[01:01.910] And God knows, Im not dying but I breathe now
[01:07.220] And God knows, its the only way to heal now
[01:12.890] With all the blood I lost for you
[01:18.140] It drowns the love I thought I knew
[01:23.830] The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him
[01:29.210] And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten
[01:34.880] And Im thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
[01:40.640] And my blood is all I see
[01:44.360] As you steal my soul from me
[01:50.600] Alarms will ring for eternity
[01:56.290] The waves will break every chain on me
[02:02.730] And God knows, Im not dying but I breathe now
[02:07.890] And God knows, its the only way to heal now
[02:13.480] With all the blood I lost for you
[02:18.910] It drowns the love I thought I knew
[02:57.760] And God knows, Im not dying but I breathe now
[03:03.040] And God knows, its the only way to heal now
[03:08.610] With all the blood I lost for you
[03:14.010] It drowns the love I thought I knew
[03:19.680] And God knows, Im not dying but I breathe now
[03:25.060] And God knows, its the only way to heal now
[03:30.750] With all the blood I lost for you
[03:35.560] It drowns the love I thought I knew
