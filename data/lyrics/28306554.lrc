[00:03.920]When I met you in the summer
[00:07.570]Took my heart a beat sound
[00:12.090]We fell in love
[00:15.290]As they leaves turned brown
[00:19.170]And we could be together baby
[00:22.550]Long the skies are blue
[00:26.840]You act so innocent now
[00:30.500]But you lie so soon
[00:34.400]When I met you in the summer
[01:19.320]When I met you in the summer
[01:22.790]Took my heart a beat sound
[01:27.040]We fell in love
[01:30.340]As they leaves turned brown
[01:34.280]And we could be together baby
[01:37.720]Long the skies are blue
[01:41.550]You act so innocent now
[01:45.190]But you lie so soon
[01:49.060]When I met you in the summer
