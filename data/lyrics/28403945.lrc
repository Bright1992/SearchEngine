[00:08.95]Silent love is calling faith
[00:12.94]To shatter me through your hallways
[00:16.91]Into echoes you can feel
[00:21.14]And rehearse the way you heal
[00:25.29]Make them dance
[00:27.03]Just like you
[00:28.77]Cause you make me move
[00:33.75]Yeah you always make me go
[00:38.29]I'll run away with your footsteps
[00:41.46]I'll build a city that dreams for two
[00:45.99]And if you lose yourself
[00:47.78]I will find you
[00:54.94]High on words we almost used
[00:58.58]We're fireworks with a wet fuse
[01:03.13]Flying planes with paper wheels
[01:06.53]To the same achilles heels
[01:10.81]Make them dance
[01:12.39]Just like you
[01:14.19]Cause you make me move
[01:16.14]
[01:19.34]Yeah you always make me go
[01:21.83]I'll run away with your footsteps
[01:27.55]I'll build a city that dreams for two
[01:31.38]And if you lose yourself
[01:33.25]I will find you
[01:54.91]Open up your skies
[01:56.85]（Turn up your night）
[01:58.62]To the speed of light
[02:00.29]（Turn up your night）
[02:02.41]Put your love in lights
[02:04.21]（Turn up your night）
[02:06.33]I will find you
[02:11.43]Make them dance
[02:13.32]Just like you
[02:14.80]Cause you make me move
[02:19.65]Yeah you always make me go
[02:21.84]
[02:23.87]Yeah you always make me go
[02:25.98]I'll run away with your footsteps
[02:31.36]I'll build a city that dreams for two
[02:35.43]And if you lose yourself
[02:37.62]I will find you
[02:43.54]Turn up your night
[02:47.26]Turn up your night
[02:51.37]Turn up your night
[02:53.93]I will find you
