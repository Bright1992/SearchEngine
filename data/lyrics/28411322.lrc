[00:09.600]And I hate to say I love you
[00:19.600] When it's so hard for me
[00:29.600]And I hate to say I want you
[00:38.600]When you make it so clear
[00:43.600]You don't want me
[00:49.600]I'd never ask you cause deep down
[00:52.600]I'm certain I know what you'd say
[00:59.600]You'd say I'm sorry believe me
[01:01.600]I love you but not in that way
[01:10.600]And I hate to say I need you
[01:19.600]I'm so reliant
[01:21.600]I'm so dependant
[01:24.600]I'm such a fool
[01:31.600]When you're not there
[01:37.600]I find myself singing the blues Can't bear
[01:44.600]Can't face the truth
[01:48.600]You will never know that feeling
[02:00.600]You will never see through these eyes
[02:10.600]I'd never ask you, cause deep down
[02:13.600]I'm certain I know what you'd say
[02:20.600]You'd say I'm sorry believe me
[02:24.600]I love you
[02:27.600]But not in that way
[02:32.600]You'd say I'm sorry believe me
[02:36.600]I love you
[02:40.600]But not in that way
