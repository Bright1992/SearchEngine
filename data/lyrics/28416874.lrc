[00:00.040]I'm friends with the monster
[00:01.970]That's under my bed
[00:04.220]Get along with the voices inside of my head
[00:08.090]
[00:08.650]You're trying to save me
[00:10.580]Stop holding your breath
[00:12.890]And you think I'm crazy
[00:14.450]
[00:15.140]Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)
[00:17.700]
[00:18.260]I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
[00:20.320]Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
[00:22.630]Wanted to receive attention for my music
[00:24.500]Wanted to be left alone, the public excuse me
[00:26.810]Been wanting my cake, I need it too, wanting it both ways
[00:29.240]Fame may be a balloon cause my ego inflated
[00:31.360]When I blew seep it was confusing
[00:33.000]Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
[00:36.060]Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
[00:38.990]Hit the lottery, oh wee
[00:40.300]With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
[00:42.300]It was like winning a huge meet
[00:43.860]Ironic cause I think I'm getting so big I need a shrink
[00:46.420]I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
[00:48.540]Going cucko and cuckier as Kool Keith
[00:50.350]But I'm actually weirder than you think
[00:52.220]Cause I'm
[00:52.660]I'm friends with the monster
[00:54.220]That's under my bed
[00:56.280]Get along with the voices inside of my head
[01:00.710]You're trying to save me
[01:02.770]Stop holding your breath
[01:05.070]And you think I'm crazy
[01:07.140]Yeah, you think I'm crazy
[01:09.010]
[01:09.630]Well, that's not fair
[01:10.330]
[01:18.690]Well, that's not fair
[01:20.120]
[01:27.610]Now I ain't much of a poet
[01:28.810]But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
[01:30.750]And don't squander it
[01:31.920]Cause you never know when it could all be over
[01:33.920]' so I keep conjuring
[01:34.790]Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
[01:37.290](Yeah, ponder it
[01:38.230]Do you wonder there's no wonder
[01:39.540]you're losing your mind the way you're brought up?)
[01:41.240]
[01:42.930]I think you've been wandering off
[01:44.330]down your and stumbled upon Jeff
[01:45.360]
[01:46.420]Cause I needed an intervention in this to
[01:48.360]intervene between me and this monster
[01:49.980]And save me from myself and all this conflict
[01:52.040]Cause the very things that
[01:53.350]I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
[01:55.090]My OCD is ' me in the head
[01:57.170]Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
[01:58.980]I'm just relaying what the voice of my head saying
[02:01.350]Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
[02:02.980]I'm friends with the monster
[02:04.410]That's under my bed
[02:06.340]Get along with the voices inside of my head
[02:10.840]You're trying to save me
[02:12.960]Stop holding your breath
[02:15.200]And you think I'm crazy
[02:17.330]Yeah, you think I'm crazy
[02:19.140]
[02:19.700]Well, that's not fair
[02:21.130]
[02:28.690]Well, that's not fair
[02:29.870]
[02:38.420]Call me crazy, but I had this vision
[02:39.850]One day that I'd walk amongst you regular civilians
[02:42.290]But until then drums get killed I'm coming straight at
[02:44.970]Emcees, blood get spilled and I
[02:46.720]Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
[02:49.090]Give every kid who got played gat
[02:50.400]Pumped the villain and shit that say back
[02:52.210]To the kids who played â€˜em
[02:53.590]I ain't here to save the fucking children
[02:55.020]But if one kid out of a hundred million
[02:57.210]Who are going through a struggle feels and relates that's great
[03:00.080]It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
[03:02.570]In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
[03:05.510]Straw in the gold chump I will spend
[03:07.320]' in a hay stack
[03:09.120]
[03:09.630]Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts
[03:11.370]I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
[03:13.680]It's nothing, I'm still friends with a
[03:15.180]I'm friends with the monster
