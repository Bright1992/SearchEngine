[00:17.30]Spend all your time waiting
[00:21.92]For that second chance
[00:25.69]For a break that would make it okay
[00:31.10]There's always some reason
[00:35.10]To feel not good enough
[00:39.01]And it's hard at the end of the day
[00:44.26]I need some distraction
[00:47.85]Oh beautiful release
[00:52.39]Memories seep from my veins
[00:57.07]Let me be empty
[01:00.97]Oh and weightless and maybe
[01:05.41]I'll find some peace tonight
[01:12.12]In the arms of the angel
[01:18.73]Fly away from here
[01:25.17]From this dark cold hotel room
[01:31.78]And the endlessness that you fear
[01:38.53]You are pulled from the wreckage
[01:45.11]Of your silent reverie
[01:52.00]You're in the arms of the angel
[01:58.78]May you find some comfort here
[02:17.28]So tired of the straight line
[02:22.21]And everywhere you turn
[02:25.48]There's vultures and thieves at your back
[02:30.07]The storm keeps on twisting
[02:33.75]You keep on building the lies
[02:37.80]That you make up for all that you lack
[02:43.00]It don't make no difference
[02:48.07]Escaping one last time
[02:51.19]It's easier to believe
[02:56.06]In this sweet madness
[02:59.20]Oh this glorious sadness
[03:04.02]That brings me to my knees
[03:16.16]In the arms of the angel
[03:22.89]Fly away from here
[03:29.83]From this dark cold hotel room
[03:36.44]And the endlessness that you fear
[03:42.89]You are pulled from the wreckage
[03:49.58]Of your silent reverie
[03:56.46]You're in the arms of the angel
[04:03.31]May you find some comfort here
[04:16.68]You're in the arms of the angel
[04:30.17]May you find some comfort here
