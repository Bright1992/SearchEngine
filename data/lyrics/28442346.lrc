[00:15.40]I found a way to be everything
[00:18.55]I dreamed of
[00:21.31]And I know it to me that I will become
[00:29.61]Who I want to be
[00:31.55]And I finally found it
[00:34.60]And I'm takin' the long way out
[00:39.46]Cause it's gonna be
[00:41.94]Somethin' special to me
[00:46.16]Somethin' special to me
[00:47.06]
[00:48.44]Days go by and I'll grow stronger
[00:51.90]It takes time but I'll never let go
[00:55.96]Days go by and I'll try harder
[00:59.99]To make it mine
[01:02.44]It's somethin' special to me
[01:05.80]It's somethin' special to me
[01:07.47]It's somethin' special to me
[01:10.23]

[01:16.87]I dreamed of
[01:18.73]And I know it to me
[01:24.49]That I will become
[01:27.87]Who I want to be
[01:29.94]And I finally found it
[01:33.19]And I'm takin' the long way out
[01:37.63]And it's gonna be
[01:40.47]Somethin' special to me
[01:43.63]Somethin' special to me

[02:06.61]More than I dreamed of
[02:09.15]This is how it should be
[02:11.10]More than I hoped for
[02:14.69]More than I dreamed of
[02:17.28]This is how it should be
[02:20.61]
[02:21.07]Days go by and I'll grow stronger
