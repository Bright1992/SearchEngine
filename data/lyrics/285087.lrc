[00:00.66] 作词 : Wanting Qu
[00:00.200] You don’t ask much, but when you do
[00:06.690] It’s always sincere and true
[00:13.950] You don’t talk much, but when you do
[00:20.680] It’s rarely about you,
[00:23.670] but I can still learn something new
[00:27.410] You know I’m gonna love you all the way
[00:34.400] Though-these three little words
[00:36.260] I never heard you say I’m ready when you are
[00:44.980] It’s not too late to startI never wanna be apart
[00:51.880] But we are, without loveI know
[00:55.950] you’re ready yes you are
[00:58.910] Because the red is in your heart
[01:02.370] I know you’ll never be too far away
[01:05.830] Because I’m your baby you’re
[01:07.710] my hide away You don’t argue,
[01:16.240] but when you do
[01:19.770] You always have good reasons toYou don’t break down,
[01:29.900] but the day you did
[01:33.670] My heart dropped to the groundSo I stood there,
[01:39.000] and cried along
[01:39.800] You know it’s gonna take a lot to push me away
[01:47.350] But time is running out I need to hear you say
[01:54.670] I’m ready when you are
[01:58.070] It’s not too late to startI never wanna be apart
[02:04.840] But we are, without loveI know you’re ready yes you are
[02:11.920] Because the red is in your heart
[02:15.429] I know you’ll never be too far away
[02:18.900] Because I’m your baby you’re my hide away
[02:26.050] You know it’s gonna take a lot to push me away
[02:32.820] But time is running out I need to hear you say
[02:40.200] I’m ready when you are
