[00:01.00] 作词 : Wanting Qu
[00:15.599]When minutes become hours
[00:20.539]When days become years
[00:24.810]And I don’t know where you are
[00:28.630]Color seems so dull without you
[00:34.569]Have we lost our minds?
[00:39.399]What have we done?
[00:43.499]But it all doesn’t seem to matter anymore
[00:52.159]When you kissed me on that street, I kissed you back
[00:57.599]You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
[01:01.549]You picked me up to lay me down
[01:06.179]When I look into your eyes
[01:08.789]I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you and I
[01:15.849]I’m drenched in your love
[01:20.499]I’m no longer able to hold it back
[01:37.819]Is it too late to ask for love?
[01:42.349]Is it wrong to feel right?
[01:48.190]When the world is winding down
[01:50.689]Thoughts of you linger around
[01:56.159]Have we lost our minds?
[02:00.788]What have we done?
[02:04.458]But it all doesn’t seem to matter anymore~~
[02:13.898]When you kissed me on that street, I kissed you back
[02:20.180]You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
[02:23.308]You picked me up to lay me down
[02:27.478]When I look into your eyes
[02:30.680]I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you and I
[02:37.480]I’m drenched in your love
[02:41.478]I’m no longer able to hold it back~~~
[02:58.998]When you kissed me on that street, I kissed you back
[03:05.890]You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
[03:09.168]You picked me up to lay me down
[03:13.580]When I look into your eyes
[03:15.778]I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you and I
[03:22.908]I’m drenched in your love
[03:27.580]I’m no longer able to hold it back
