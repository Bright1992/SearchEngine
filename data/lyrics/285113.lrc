[00:10.558]I must be crazy
[00:16.721]Thought you'd understand
[00:22.872]The shoulder you lent me
[00:29.124]was made out of sand
[00:35.277]Oh love shoud be easy
[00:40.128]But I think otherwise
[00:42.928]And it's kind of silly
[00:45.278]I thought I figured it out
[00:52.836]Everything is possible
[00:55.638]But it's a wrong statement after all
[00:58.988]We are each other's trouble
[01:01.589]But it's nobody's fault
[01:04.643]nobody's fault
[01:13.953]And I remember
[01:16.652]watching sad movies alone
[01:20.103]I would cry and cry ,cry and cry
[01:23.811]as the end of credits roll
[01:26.262]Until the end these tears no one could see
[01:32.281]No need to hide I could be me
[01:39.636]Everything is possible
[01:42.340]But it's a wrong statement after all
[01:45.640]We are each other's trouble
[01:48.292]But it's nobody's fault
[01:52.043]nobody's fault
[02:01.427]Who is right who is wrong
[02:07.677]Who is still standing their ground
[02:14.030]Love or hate
[02:16.583]You know I rather not debate
[02:19.350]When it's one and one
[02:22.953]It's both or none
[02:29.557]Everything is possible
[02:32.109]But it's a wrong statement after all
[02:35.459]We are each other's trouble
[02:38.259]But it's nobody's fault
[02:41.912]nobody's fault
[02:45.210]Everything is possible
[02:47.711]But it's a wrong statement after all
[02:50.970]We are each other's trouble
[02:54.439]But it's nobody's fault
[02:56.838]nobody's fault
[03:03.795]We are each other's trouble
[03:06.396]But it's nobody's fault
[03:09.288]And it's nobody's fault
