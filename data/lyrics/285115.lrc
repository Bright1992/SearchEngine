[00:12.850]I'm older than I am
[00:16.510] I wish you were here
[00:19.380]Who am I who I am
[00:25.500]Surrounded by empty spaces
[00:32.310]I need love well who doesn't
[00:38.900]standing here
[00:42.200]No tides no sand to drown my fears away
[00:48.440]And I'll wait wait wait for your love
[00:57.620]And I'll give give it all
[01:03.860]There ain't no way no way the sun don't shine it hide away
[01:10.600]So shine over me
[01:14.400]
[01:16.789]It's inevitable
[01:22.360]Everything around me changes even though I don't want them to
[01:29.600]I will be looking forward to what tomorrow has in store for me
[01:40.390]
[01:42.630]I'm standing here
[01:45.710]No tides no sand to drown my fears away
[01:52.300]And I'll wait wait wait for your love
[02:01.100]And I'll give give it all
[02:05.410]
[02:07.590]There ain't no way no way the sun don't shine it hide away
[02:14.270]So shine over me
[02:19.150]
[02:20.770]Crumbled heart
[02:27.579]Broken words
[02:34.700]I will face obstacles in life
[02:43.500]
[03:10.800]And I'll wait wait wait for your love
[03:16.190]And I'll give give it all
[03:22.550]There ain't no way no way the sun don't shine it hide away
[03:29.290]So shine over me
