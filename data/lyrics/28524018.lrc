[00:10.600]Hello, August moon,
[00:12.270]where are the stars of the night?
[00:15.380]You promised me too soon,
[00:17.210]'cause it's been cloudy all night
[00:20.250]And the weatherman said if you're not well,
[00:23.660]stay in bed
[00:25.350]'Cause I've been feeling down and blue
[00:27.830]and it's cloudy in my head
[00:30.400]Instead of going out to some restaurant,
[00:33.290]I stay home in bed
[00:35.300]But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
[00:40.330]I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
[00:46.060]Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
[00:51.010]And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more
[00:55.470]If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
[01:00.970]We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss,
[01:03.490]a love forever true
[01:06.030]Instead of going out to some restaurant,
[01:08.430]I'll stay here with you
[01:10.750]But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
[01:15.880]I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
[01:21.690]It seems you don't know
[01:24.010]we reached the hightened mountain
[01:26.580]Every time I seem to disappear
[01:31.840]And together, we will fly,
[01:34.300]we'll dance up in the heaven
[01:37.440]I can really feel it when you're near
[01:41.620]
[01:53.250]And the weatherman said if you're not well,
