[00:12.060]Guess it's true
[00:12.650]I'm not good
[00:13.350]At a one night stand
[00:17.550]But I still need love
[00:18.690]Cos I'm just a man
[00:23.310]These nights never seem to go to plan
[00:28.820]I don't want you to leave
[00:30.340]Will you hold my hand
[00:33.210]Oh won't you
[00:34.560]Stay with me
[00:39.150]Cos you're
[00:40.510]All I need
[00:44.720]This ain't love
[00:46.250]It's clear to see
[00:50.010]But darling
[00:51.650]Stay with me
[00:57.960]Why am I so emotional?
[01:02.810]No it's not a good look
[01:04.130]Gain some self control
[01:08.360]Deep down I know this never works
[01:14.020]But you can lay with me
[01:15.580]So it doesn't hurt
[01:18.180]Oh won't you
[01:19.730]Stay with me
[01:24.260]Cos you're
[01:25.610]All I need
[01:29.930]This ain't love
[01:31.630]It's clear to see
[01:35.180]But darling
[01:36.780]Stay with me
[02:03.700]Oh won't you
[02:05.230]Stay with me
[02:09.500]Cos you're
[02:10.850]All I need
[02:15.190]This ain't love
[02:16.890]It's clear to see
[02:20.540]But darling
[02:21.760]Stay with me
[02:25.990]Oh won't you
[02:27.400]Stay with me
[02:32.120]Cos you're
[02:33.290]All I need
[02:37.760]This ain't love
[02:39.430]It's clear to see
[02:43.160]But darling
[02:44.820]Stay with me
