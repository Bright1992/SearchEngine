[00:12.060]Guess it's true
[00:12.650]I'm not good
[00:13.350]At a one night stand
[00:17.550]But I still need love
[00:18.690]Cos I'm just a man
[00:23.310]These nights never seem to go to plan
[00:28.820]I don't want you to leave
[00:30.340]Will you hold my hand
[00:33.210]Oh won't you
[00:34.560]Stay with me
[00:39.150]Cos you're
[00:40.510]All I need
[00:44.720]This ain't love
[00:46.250]It's clear to see
[00:50.010]But darling
[00:51.650]Stay with me
[00:58.860]Why am I so emotional?
[01:03.710]No it's not a good look
[01:05.030]Gain some self control
[01:09.260]Deep down I know this never works
[01:14.920]But you can lay with me
[01:16.480]So it doesn't hurt
[01:19.080]Oh won't you
[01:20.630]Stay with me
[01:25.160]Cos you're
[01:26.510]All I need
[01:30.830]This ain't love
[01:32.530]It's clear to see
[01:36.080]But darling
[01:37.680]Stay with me
[02:04.600]Oh won't you
[02:06.130]Stay with me
[02:10.400]Cos you're
[02:11.750]All I need
[02:16.090]This ain't love
[02:17.790]It's clear to see
[02:21.440]But darling
[02:22.660]Stay with me
[02:26.890]Oh won't you
[02:28.300]Stay with me
[02:33.020]Cos you're
[02:34.190]All I need
[02:38.660]This ain't love
[02:40.330]It's clear to see
[02:44.060]But darling
[02:45.720]Stay with me
