[00:12.270]Tell me that you turned down the man
[00:15.220]Who asked for your hand
[00:17.600]Cause you're waiting for me
[00:20.930]And I know
[00:22.300]You're gonna be away a while
[00:25.320]But I've got no plans at all to leave
[00:31.240]Would you take away my hopes and dreams
[00:36.520]And just stay with me
[00:42.320]All my senses come to life
[00:46.620]While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
[00:51.730]Have ever been and I'll never leave again
[00:59.910]Cause you are the only one
[01:02.240]And all my friends have gone to find
[01:07.030]Another place to let their hearts collide
[01:11.960]Just promise me
[01:14.570]You'll never leave again
[01:20.210]Cause you are the only one
[01:28.720]Take my hand and my
[01:31.170]Heart and soul, I will
[01:33.470]Only have these eyes for you
[01:37.620]And you know, everything changes but
[01:41.390]We'll be strangers if, we see this through
[01:47.870]You could stay within these walls or leave
[01:52.850]But just stay with me
[01:58.970]All my senses come to life
[02:03.080]While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
[02:08.190]Have ever been and I'll never leave again
[02:16.440]Cause you are the only one
[02:18.760]And all my friends have gone to find
[02:23.400]Another place to let their hearts collide
[02:28.630]Just promise me
[02:31.230]You'll always be a friend
[02:36.820]Cause you are the only one
[02:41.090]I'm stumbling out drunk
[02:43.250]Getting myself lost
[02:45.850]I am so gone
[02:48.300]So tell me the way you home
[02:50.850]I listen to sad songs
[02:53.460]Singing about love
[02:57.150]And where it goes wrong
[03:23.180]All my senses come to life
[03:27.430]While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
[03:32.870]Have ever been and I'll never leave again
[03:40.630]Cause you are the only one
[03:43.060]And all my friends have gone to find
[03:47.550]Another place to let their hearts collide
[03:52.990]Just promise me
[03:55.470]You'll always be a friend
[04:01.030]Cause you are the only one
