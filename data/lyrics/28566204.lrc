[00:00.650]It's just another night
[00:03.490]And I'm staring at the moon
[00:08.200]I saw a shooting star
[00:10.300]And thought of you
[00:13.780]I sang a lullaby
[00:16.380]By the waterside and knew
[00:21.460]If you were here,
[00:23.040]I'd sing to you
[00:26.440]You're on the other side
[00:28.920]As the skyline splits in two
[00:34.320]I'm miles away from seeing you
[00:39.440]I can see the stars
[00:41.920]From America
[00:42.770]
[00:46.950]I wonder, do you see them, too?
[00:50.690]So open your eyes and see
[00:56.160]The way our horizons meet
[01:03.210]And all of the lights will lead
[01:09.440]Into the night with me
[01:14.970]
[01:16.450]And I know these scars will bleed
[01:20.840]
[01:22.750]But both of our hearts believe
[01:26.000]All of these stars will guide us home
[01:36.140]I can hear your heart
[01:42.090]On the radio beat
[01:47.430]They're playing 'Chasing Cars'
[01:49.320]And I thought of us
[01:51.450]Back to the time,
[01:54.390]You were lying next to me
[02:00.580]I looked across and fell in love
[02:05.530]So I took your hand
[02:07.210]Back through lamp lit streets I knew
[02:13.380]Everything led back to you
[02:16.640]So can you see the stars?
[02:21.180]Over Amsterdam
[02:25.950]You're the song my heart is
[02:28.350]Beating to
[02:29.710]So open your eyes and see
[02:34.820]The way our horizons meet
[02:41.910]And all of the lights will lead
[02:47.940]Into the night with me
[02:55.580]And I know these scars will bleed
[03:01.210]But both of our hearts believe
[03:07.450]All of these stars will guide us home
[03:15.440]And, oh, oh, oh
[03:36.850]
[03:41.850]I can see the stars
[03:43.930]From America
