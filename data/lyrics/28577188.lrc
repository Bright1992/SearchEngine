[00:14.150]I don't have much to give, but I don't care for gold
[00:20.840]What use is money, when you need someone to hold
[00:27.370]Don't have direction I'm just rolling down this road
[00:34.220]Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold
[00:40.010]You'll never know the endless nights,
[00:43.810]The rhyming of the rain,
[00:47.080]Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name
[00:54.280]Pack up and leave everything
[00:57.600]Don't you see what I can bring
[01:01.330]Can't keep this beating heart at bay
[01:07.950]Set my midnight terror free
[01:11.830]I will give you all of me
[01:14.380]Just leave your lover, leave him for me
[01:21.250]Leave your lover, leave him for me
[01:41.970]We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old
[01:49.220]I'm in love with you and you will never know,
[01:55.510]But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone
[02:02.080]Spare you the rising storms and let the river flow
[02:08.300]You'll never know the endless nights
[02:11.640]The rhyming of the rain
[02:14.950]Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name
[02:22.010]Pack up and leave everything
[02:25.810]Don't you see what I can bring
[02:29.370]Can't keep this beating heart at bay
[02:35.730]Set my midnight terror free,
[02:39.110]I will give you all of me
[02:41.580]Just leave your lover, leave him for me
[02:48.760]Leave your lover, leave him for me
[02:55.410]Leave your lover, leave him for me
