[00:25.010]You and me we made a vow
[00:30.540]For better or for worse
[00:36.510]I can't believe you let me down
[00:40.420]But the proof is in the way it hurts
[00:48.100]For months on end I've had my doubts
[00:53.980]Denying every tear
[00:59.880]I wish this would be over now
[01:03.870]But I know that I still need you here
[01:09.480]You say I'm crazy
[01:15.870]Cause you don't think I know what you've done
[01:21.250]But when you call me baby
[01:27.630]I know I'm not the only one
[01:35.050]You've been so unfaithful
[01:40.930]Now sadly I know why
[01:46.570]Your heart is unobtainable
[01:50.470]Even though Lord knows you kept mine
[01:56.380]You say I'm crazy
[02:02.470]Cause you don't think I know what you've done
[02:08.130]But when you call me baby
[02:14.390]I know I'm not the only one
[02:21.300]I have loved you for many years
[02:26.680]Maybe I am just not enough
[02:32.630]You've made me realise my deepest fear
[02:37.780]By lying and tearing us up
[02:43.260]You say I'm crazy
[02:49.620]Cause you don't think I know what you've done
[02:54.890]But when you call me baby
[03:01.290]I know I'm not the only one
[03:06.840]You say I'm crazy
[03:13.120]Cause you don't think I know what you've done
[03:18.670]But when you call me baby
[03:24.770]I know I'm not the only one
[03:30.660]I'm always not the only one
[03:36.140]I'm always not the only one
[03:42.280]And I know And I know And I know And I know
[03:45.020]And I know And I know
[03:48.150]I know I'm not the only one
