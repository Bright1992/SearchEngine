[00:11.17]You know what I mean
[00:13.83]It's like walking in the heat all day with no water
[00:22.04]It's like waiting for a friend
[00:24.82]Watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner
[00:30.08]
[00:32.33]
[00:33.41]Or losing in an argument
[00:36.34]Although you're right can't get your thoughts in order
[00:44.35]Still I refrain from talking at you, talking on
[00:50.01]You know me well I don't explain
[00:55.52]But what the hell
[00:58.59]Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?
[01:04.39]Wasting all my precious time
[01:07.28]Oh, the truth spills out
[01:12.64]And oooooo oh I
[01:16.23]I've told you now
[01:18.24]
[01:22.94]
[01:23.97]You know what I mean
[01:26.59]Although I try my best I still let down the team
[01:34.61]You're everything I want
[01:37.72]Why should I resist when you are there for me?
[01:45.45]Should I refrain from talking at you, talking on
[01:51.37]You know me well I don't explain
[01:57.03]But what the hell
[02:00.01]Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?
[02:05.50]Wasting all my precious time
[02:08.34]Oh the truth spills out
[02:13.76]And oooooo oh I
[02:18.12]I've told you now
[02:23.46]I've told you now
[02:27.43]And I've told you now!
[02:34.25]And I've told you now!
[02:41.21]Still I refrain from talking at you, talking on
[02:46.93]You know me well I don't explain
[02:52.64]So what the hell
[02:55.64]Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?
[03:01.17]Wasting all my precious time
[03:04.39]What the hell
[03:06.95]Why do you think I come 'round here on my own will?
[03:12.31]Wasting all my precious time
[03:15.37]Oh, the truth spills out
[03:20.37]And oooooo oh I
[03:24.87]I've told you now
