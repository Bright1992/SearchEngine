[00:00.350]He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
[00:04.990]He could be your preacher, when your soul is down
[00:09.840]He could be your lawyer on a witness stand
[00:15.380]But he'll never love you like I can, can
[00:19.610]He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
[00:24.370]He could be a trophy of a one night stand
[00:29.780]He could have your humour, but I don't understand
[00:36.070]He'll never love you like I can, can, can
[00:40.210]Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
[00:44.870]When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
[00:49.820]There may be lovers who hold out their hands
[00:54.070]But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
[00:59.870]He’ll never love you like I can, can
[01:03.460]A chance encounter of circumstance
[01:08.080]Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
[01:12.870]He could be the silence in this mayhem
[01:18.240]But then again,
[01:19.880]he’ll never love you like I can, can, can
[01:24.310]Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
[01:29.000]when mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
[01:33.920]There may be lovers who hold out their hands
[01:38.180]But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
[01:44.020]He’ll never love you like I can, can can
[01:48.760]He’ll never love you like I can, can can
[01:52.900]We both have demons that we can't stand
[01:58.290]I love your demons, like devils can
[02:02.970]If you're still seeking an honest man
[02:07.730]Then stop deceiving, Lord please
[02:15.640]Why are you looking down only one road
[02:20.170]When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
[02:25.210]There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
[02:30.510]He'll never love you like I can, can, can
[02:35.300]He'll never love you like I can, can, can
[02:40.150]He'll never love you like I can, can, can
[02:44.490]
