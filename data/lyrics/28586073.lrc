[00:13.860]My mind runs away to you
[00:16.740]With a thought I hope you'll see
[00:19.930]Can't see where it's wondered to
[00:23.180]But I know where it wants to be
[00:26.280]I'm waiting patiently
[00:29.450]Though time is moving slow
[00:32.670]I have one vacancy
[00:35.920]And I wanted you to know
[00:38.100]That you're the one
[00:41.900]Designed for me
[00:44.830]A distant stranger
[00:48.260]That I will complete
[00:51.290]I know you're right but
[00:54.560]We're meant to be
[00:57.530]So keep your head down
[01:02.530]And make it to me
[01:04.640]
[01:09.210]Make it to me
[01:11.240]
[01:17.540]So sick of this loneliness
[01:20.680]It seems such a waste of breath
[01:23.890]So much that I need to say
[01:27.040]So much to get off my chest
[01:30.190]I'm waiting patiently
[01:33.460]Though time is moving slow
[01:36.610]I have one vacancy
[01:39.810]And I wanted you to know
[01:42.140]That you're the one
[01:45.500]Designed for me
[01:48.680]A distant stranger
[01:52.180]That I will complete
[01:55.170]I know you're right but
[01:58.560]We're meant to be
[02:01.810]So keep your head down
[02:06.680]And make it to me
[02:11.350]
[02:13.230]Make it to me
[02:16.040]
[02:19.760]And make it to me
[02:22.510]
[02:26.100]Make it to me
