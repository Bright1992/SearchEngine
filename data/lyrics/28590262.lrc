[00:06.01]Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin’,
[00:10.23]"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'
[00:14.45]But you got the music, you've got the music,
[00:19.11]In you, don't you?
[00:24.24]Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling, like,
[00:29.15]It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving,
[00:33.08]You for the music, you for the music,
[00:37.55]It's true, it's true.
[00:41.56]I push it hard, you pull away,
[00:44.06]I'm feeling hot and on fire.
[00:46.04]I'm feelin' like there's no one else,
[00:48.89]Who makes me higher than higher.
[00:50.77]Te deseo, cariño, boy, it's you I desire,
[00:55.52]Your love, your love, your love.
[01:02.09]I can see my baby swinging,
[01:06.29]His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up.
[01:11.05]On the balcony and I'm singing,
[01:14.68]Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love.
[01:19.81]I can see my sweet boy swaying,
[01:24.68]He's crazy y Cubano como yo, la la.
[01:29.63]On the balcony and I'm saying,
[01:33.13]Move baby, move baby, I'm in love.
[01:37.98]I'm in love, I’m in love.
[01:42.31](I’m in love, I'm in love).
[01:47.01]Down on the West Coast, they got their icons,
[01:51.87]The silver starlets, their queens of Saigons,
[01:56.13]But you got the music, you've got the music,
[02:00.57]In you, don't you?
[02:04.45]You pull me close, I push away,
[02:07.20]I'm feelin' hot to the touch.
[02:09.09]You say you miss me and I wanna say,
[02:12.43]"I miss you so much."
[02:13.85]But something keeps me really quiet,
[02:16.57]I'm alive, I'm a lush,
[02:18.16]Hold me close and you say,
[02:20.37]"Hush, baby, hush."
[02:24.24]I can see my baby swinging,
[02:29.35]His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up.
[02:34.19]On the balcony and I'm singing,
[02:37.62]Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love.
[02:43.29]I can see my sweet boy swaying,
[02:47.78]He's crazy y Cubano como yo, la la.
[02:52.61]On the balcony and I'm saying,
[02:56.24]Move baby, move baby, I'm in love.
[03:01.85]I can see my baby swinging,
[03:06.58]His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up.
[03:11.16]On the balcony and I'm singing,
[03:14.63]Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love.
[03:20.25]I can see my sweet boy swaying,
[03:24.77]He's crazy y Cubano como yo, la la.
[03:29.85]On the balcony and I'm saying,
[03:32.85]Move baby, move baby, I'm in love.
[03:38.91]I’m in love, I’m in love.
[03:40.03](I'm in love).
