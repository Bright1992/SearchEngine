[00:20.96]My baby lives in shades of blue
[00:25.41]Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
[00:30.47]He lives in California too
[00:35.68]He drives a Chevy Malibu
[00:40.43]And when he calls, he calls for me, and not for you
[00:49.69]He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby too
[01:00.09]But I can't fix him, can't make him better
[01:10.35]And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
[01:21.74]But you are unfixable
[01:32.22]I can't break through your world
[01:42.03]Cause you live in shades of cool
[01:52.65]Your heart is unbreakable
[02:03.43]My baby lives in shades of cool
[02:07.67]Cool heart and hands and aptitude
[02:13.50]He lives for love, for women too
[02:18.05]I'm one of many on his blue
[02:22.67]And when he calls, he calls for me, and not for you
[02:32.03]He prays for love, he prays for peace, and maybe someone new
[02:42.60]But I can't help him, can't make him better
[02:53.19]And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
[03:04.62]Cause you are unfixable
[03:15.55]I can't break through your world
[03:25.73]Cause you live in shades of cool
[03:37.67]Your heart is unbreakable
[03:47.61]Your hot, hot weather in the summer
[03:53.98]Hot, hot, neglectful lover
[03:59.19]Hot, hot weather in the summer
[04:04.99]Hot, neglectful lover
[04:10.33]You’re crumbling, sadly
[04:20.96]You're sadly crumbling
[04:29.66]You are unfixable
[04:40.07]I can't break through your world
[04:50.31]Cause you live in shades of cool
[05:01.26]Your heart is unbreakable
