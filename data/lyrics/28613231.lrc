[00:06.58]All around me are familiar faces
[00:11.41]Worn out places, worn out faces
[00:17.58]Going nowhere with the daily races
[00:22.06]Going nowhere, going nowhere
[00:28.04]And I find it kind of funny
[00:31.28]I find it kind of sad
[00:33.73]The dreams in which I'm dying
[00:35.99]Are the best I've ever had
[00:38.97]I find it hard to tell you
[00:41.31]Cause I find it hard to take
[00:44.25]When people run in circles
[00:46.90]It's a very very mad world
[00:54.66]I Went to school and I was very nervous
[00:59.20]No one knew me, no one knew me
[01:05.22]Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson
[01:10.05]Look right through me, look right through me
[01:15.98]And I find it kind of funny
[01:19.12]I find it kind of sad
[01:21.57]The dreams in which I'm dying
[01:23.96]Are the best I've ever had
[01:26.85]I find it hard to tell you
[01:29.05]Cause I find it hard to take
[01:32.18]When people run in circles
[01:34.37]It's a very very mad world
[01:42.60]Mad world
[01:48.33]Mad world
[01:53.17]Mad world
