[00:42.04]Whenever my head starts to hurt
[00:44.73]Before it goes from bad to feeling worse
[00:48.04]I turn off my phone
[00:49.86]I get down low
[00:51.71]I put my hands in the dirt
[00:54.62]I try to stop the world from moving so fast
[00:57.54]Try to get a grip on where I'm at
[01:00.73]And simplify this daisy life
[01:04.28]And put my feet in the grass
[01:07.17]I'm going back to the Earth
[01:10.42]I'm going back to the Earth
[01:13.36]I'm going back to work
[01:16.60]I'm going back to the Earth
[01:32.45]Yes I'm going Back...
[01:33.31]The only explanation for our high rise
[01:35.44]Must be that everybody wants to get it high
[01:38.73]And move on up to a deluxe
[01:41.64]Up on in the sky
[01:44.93]Was
[01:45.25]The higher we go, the taller we grow old
[01:48.16]We lose sight of our land below
[01:51.04]You can have your place up in outer space
[01:54.79]Cause my home is where my food is grown
[02:10.56][01:57.84]I'm going back to the Earth
[02:13.22][02:00.64]I'm going back to the Earth
[02:16.81][02:03.84]I'm going back to work
[02:20.21][02:07.08]I'm going back to the Earth
[02:23.19]We are animals (we are animals)
[02:26.09]We are wild (we are wild)
[02:29.38]And we'll start with emotions at the bottom of the ocean
[02:33.16]I was feeling from the top of the trees
[02:35.49]We are animals (we are animals)
[02:38.60]We are wild (we are wild)
[02:42.18]And we'll truly be forgiven when we start getting back to living
[02:45.57]with the land in harmony
[02:48.08]I’m going back to the earth
[02:51.11]I’m going back to the earth
[02:54.21]I'm going back to work
[02:57.51]I'm going back to the Earth
[03:00.37]Oh yeah…
