[00:08.73]What would I do without your smart mouth
[00:12.28]Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
[00:15.89]Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
[00:23.36]What's going on in that beautiful mind
[00:27.08]I'm on your magical mystery ride
[00:30.82]And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
[00:39.00]My head's under water
[00:42.42]But I'm breathing fine
[00:50.34]You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
[00:51.96]'Cause all of me
[00:54.65]Loves all of you
[00:58.12]Love your curves and all your edges
[01:01.70]All your perfect imperfections
[01:05.29]Give your all to me
[01:08.72]I'll give my all to you
[01:12.54]You're my end and my beginning
[01:16.15]Even when I lose I'm winning
[01:20.41]'Cause I give you all, all of me
[01:26.78]And you give me all, all of you, oh
[01:36.04]How many times do I have to tell you
[01:39.35]Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
[01:43.04]The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
[01:50.08]You're my downfall, you're my muse
[01:53.80]My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
[01:57.46]I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
[02:05.33]My head's under water
[02:08.51]But I'm breathing fine
[02:12.42]You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
[02:18.14]'Cause all of me
[02:20.69]Loves all of you
[02:25.39]Love your curves and all your edges
[02:28.07]All your perfect imperfections
[02:31.18]Give your all to me
[02:34.90]I'll give my all to you
[02:38.41]You're my end and my beginning
[02:42.46]Even when I lose I'm winning
[02:45.48]'Cause I give you all, all of me
[02:52.69]And you give me all, all of you, oh
[03:02.94]Give me all of you
[03:05.40]Cards on the table, we're both shoing hearts
[03:09.93]Risking it all, though it's hard
[03:15.31]'Cause all of me
[03:18.40]Loves all of you
[03:21.22]Love your curves and all your edges
[03:24.86]All your perfect imperfections
[03:28.58]Give your all to me
[03:32.09]I'll give my all to you
[03:35.61]You're my end and my beginning
[03:39.32]Even when I lose I'm winning
[03:42.75]'Cause I give you all, all of me
[03:49.96]And you give me all, all of you
[03:57.12]I'll give you all of me.
[04:04.22]And you give me all, all of you, oh
[04:12.08]
