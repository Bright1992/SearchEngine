[00:09.620]Ah lahmlahlah
[00:12.910]I met this girl late last year
[00:14.860]She said don't you worry if I disappear
[00:17.510]I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
[00:19.880]I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
[00:22.560]But then I jump right in
[00:23.980]A week later return
[00:25.120]I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
[00:27.620]But I gave her my time for two or three nights
[00:30.230]Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
[00:32.660]I went away for months until our paths crossed again
[00:37.580]She told me I was never looking for a friend
[00:39.860]Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
[00:42.400]Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
[00:44.790]We'll be in between the sheets until the late AM
[00:47.310]Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
[00:49.920]She's singing
[00:50.890]Ah lahmlahlah
[00:52.130]Don't fuck with my love
[00:54.030]That heart is so cold
[00:56.460]All over my arm
[00:58.860]I don't wanna know that babe
[01:00.940]Ah lahmlahlah
[01:02.230]Don't fuck with my love
[01:04.200]I told her she knows
[01:06.450]Take aim and reload
[01:08.990]I don't wanna know that babe
[01:10.960]Ah lahmlahlah
[01:12.840]For a couple weeks I
[01:14.120]Only want to see her
[01:15.490]We drink away the days with a take away pizza
[01:17.800]Before a text message was the only way to reach her
[01:20.300]Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
[01:22.890]Singing out Aretha
[01:24.090]All over the track like a feature
[01:25.950]Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
[01:28.640]But me and her we make money the same way
[01:30.940]Four cities, two planes the same day
[01:33.530]Those shows have never been what it's about
[01:35.880]But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
[01:38.310]I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
[01:40.840]But we should get on a plane
[01:42.200]Or we'll be missing it now
[01:43.460]Wish I'd have written it down
[01:44.700]The way that things played out
[01:45.840]When she was kissing him
[01:47.240]How? I was confused about
[01:48.450]She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
[01:51.320]Ah lahmlahlah
[01:52.550]Don't fuck with my love
[01:54.810]That heart is so cold
[01:57.290]All over my arm
[01:59.580]I don't wanna know that babe
[02:01.530]Ah lahmlahlah
[02:02.470]Don't fuck with my love
[02:05.050]I told her she knows
[02:07.290]Take aim and reload
[02:09.600]I don't wanna know that babe
[02:11.650]Ah lahmlahlah
[02:13.990]on my hotel door
[02:16.490]I don't even know if she knows what for
[02:18.870]She was crying on my shoulder
[02:20.290]I already told ya
[02:21.700]Trust and respect is what we do this for
[02:24.060]I never intended to be next
[02:26.040]But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
[02:29.030]And I never saw him as a threat
[02:31.490]Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
[02:34.290]It's not like we were both on tour
[02:36.830]We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
[02:38.980]And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
[02:41.470]But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
[02:44.290]This is not the way you realize what you wanted
[02:47.110]It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
[02:49.280]All this time God knows I'm singing
[02:52.170]Ah lahmlahlah
[02:53.260]Don't fuck with my love
[02:55.570]That heart is so cold
[02:57.960]All over my arm
[03:00.150]I don't wanna know that babe
[03:02.150]Ah lahmlahlah
[03:03.620]Don't fuck with my love
[03:05.600]I told her she knows
[03:08.140]Take aim and reload
[03:10.190]I don't wanna know that babe
[03:12.300]Ah lahmlahlah
[03:13.530]Don't fuck with my love
[03:15.390]That heart is so cold
[03:18.200]All over my arm
[03:20.400]I don't wanna know that babe
[03:22.380]Ah lahmlahlah
[03:23.500]Don't fuck with my love
[03:25.760]I told her she knows
[03:28.310]Take aim and reload
[03:30.420]I don't wanna know that babe
[03:32.470]Ah lahmlahlah
