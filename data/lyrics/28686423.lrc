[00:08.92]Rev-up, leave 'em all in the dust
[00:12.47]Got a Cadillac six pack vision of us
[00:16.36]Tonight we ride high into the desert sky
[00:25.79]Hands up, feel the heat in the air
[00:29.46]Legends never die, they play truth or dareTonight
[00:32.66]
[00:34.20]we stop time, let go of the wheel and drive
[00:39.13]How does it feel to fly?
[00:43.29]We are the stars that shine
[00:47.68]We don't even have to try
[00:51.43]We could go down in flames
[00:56.02]But we'll melt the world away
[00:59.47]All I know is you're my rock and roll
[01:02.70]And wherever we go, we are heroes, heroes
[01:07.93]They don't make 'em like you and I
[01:13.27]Legends never die
[01:23.92]Undressed in a beautiful mess
[01:27.42]But I got your gold heart right here on my chest
[01:31.39]They say we're crazy, so baby let's go insane
[01:39.87]It's anarchy when we're together
[01:43.64]I know we will live forever
[01:47.71]Maybe one day, we'll make history
[01:53.25]How does it feels to be free?
[01:57.20]We are the stars that shine
[02:01.58]We don't even have to try
[02:05.07]We could go down in flames
[02:09.60]But we'll melt the world away
[02:12.86]All I know is you're my rock and roll
[02:16.05]And wherever we go, we are heroes, heroes
[02:21.20]They don't make 'em like you and I
[02:26.21]Legends never die,die,die
[02:34.34]Legends never die, die, die
[02:42.36]Legends never
[02:45.02]Burn out, just to fade away
[02:48.47]We keep the clock turning like a figure eight Tonight
[02:52.36]
[02:53.22]we stop time
[02:54.67]let go of the wheel
[02:57.42]And drive
[03:02.41]We are the stars that shine
[03:06.65]We don't even have to try
[03:10.21]We could go down in flames
[03:14.68]But we'll melt the world away
[03:18.06]All I know is you're my rock and roll
[03:21.16]And wherever we go, we are heroes, heroes
[03:26.48]They don't make 'em like you and I
[03:31.25]Legends never die,die,die
[03:39.31]Legends never die, die, die
[03:47.50]Legends never die, die, die
[03:55.71]Legends never die, die, die
[04:03.58]Legends never die, die, die
[04:11.63]Legends never die, die, die
