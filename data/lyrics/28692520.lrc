[00:18.99]You look so wonderful in your dress
[00:22.89]I love your hair like that
[00:26.76]The way it falls on the side of your neck
[00:30.63]Down your shoulders and back
[00:33.74]
[00:34.67]We are surrounded by all of these lies
[00:38.23]And people who talk too much
[00:42.53]You've got that kind of look in your eyes
[00:45.57]As if no one knows anything but us
[00:48.91]
[00:49.99]And should this be the last thing I see
[00:54.12]I want you to know it's enough for me
[00:57.67]Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
[01:03.79]
[01:05.67]I'm so in love, so in love
[01:13.47]So in love, so in love
[01:21.26]
[01:22.43]You look so beautiful in this light
[01:26.20]Your silhouette over me
[01:30.25]The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
[01:33.31]Is the Tenerife Sea
[01:36.67]
[01:37.63]And all of the voices surrounding us here
[01:41.18]They just fade out when you take a breath
[01:45.46]Just say the word and I will disappear
[01:48.97]Into the wilderness
[01:52.10]
[01:53.07]And should this be the last thing I see
[01:57.01]I want you to know it's enough for me
[02:01.05]Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
[02:06.01]
[02:08.42]I'm so in love, so in love
[02:16.20]So in love, so in love
[02:23.47]
[02:24.71][x6:]
[02:25.16]Lumière, darling
[02:32.70]Lumière over me
[03:11.64]
[03:11.86]And should this be the last thing I see
[03:15.17]I want you to know it's enough for me
[03:19.17]Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
[03:25.00]
[03:26.75]I'm so in love, so in love
[03:34.64]So in love, love, love, love,
[03:38.63]So in love
[03:41.58]
[03:43.62]You looked so wonderful in your dress
[03:47.50]I loved your hair like that
[03:51.37]And in the moment I knew you back
[03:54.94]
