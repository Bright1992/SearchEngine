[00:14.19]Where do we go from here?
[00:20.81]This isn't where we inteded to be
[00:27.44]We had it all
[00:30.40]You believed in me
[00:33.65]I believed in you
[00:40.72]Certainties disappear
[00:47.32]What do we do
[00:50.02]for our dream to survive
[00:54.23]How do we keep all our passions alive
[01:00.37]as we used to do
[01:07.35]Deep in my heart I'm concealing
[01:13.98]Things that I'm longing to say
[01:20.64]Scared to confess what I'm feeling
[01:27.23]Frightened you'll slip away
[01:32.58]You must love me
[01:38.84]You must love me
[01:47.33]Why are you at my side
[01:53.96]How can I be any use to you now
[02:00.62]Give me a chance and I'll let you see how
[02:07.16]nothing has changed
[02:14.00]Deep in my heart I'm concealing
[02:20.54]Things that I'm longing to say
[02:27.25]Scared to confess what I'm feeling
[02:33.89]Frightened you'll slip away
[02:39.27]you must love me
[03:03.16]
