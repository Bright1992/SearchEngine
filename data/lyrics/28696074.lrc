[01:06.29]When I met you in the summer
[01:09.94]To my heartbeat's sound
[01:13.88]We fell in love
[01:17.21]As the leaves turned brown
[01:21.09]And we could be together baby
[01:24.89]As long as skies are blue
[01:28.92]You act so innocent now
[01:32.46]But you lied so soon
[01:36.09]When I met you in the summer
[02:32.69]When I met you in the summer
[02:36.47]To my heartbeat's sound
[02:40.37]We fell in love
[02:43.85]As the leaves turned brown
[02:47.88]And we could be together baby
[02:51.25]As long as skies are blue
[02:55.45]You act so innocent now
[02:59.01]But you lied so soon
[03:02.50]When I met you in the summer
[03:08.98]Summer
