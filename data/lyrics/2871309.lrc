[00:14.630]I will not make
[00:17.270]The same mistakes that you did
[00:20.680]I will not let myself
[00:24.470]Cause my heart so much misery
[00:28.170]I will not break
[00:30.790]The way you did, you fell so hard
[00:35.020]I’ve learned the hard way
[00:37.830]To never let it get that far
[00:41.940]Because of you
[00:43.690]I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[00:48.710]Because of you
[00:50.380]I learned to play on the safe side
[00:52.380]so I don’t get hurt
[00:55.530]Because of you
[00:57.210]I find it hard to trust not only me, but
[00:58.380]everyone around me
[01:02.490]Because of you I am afraid
[01:11.100]I lose my way
[01:13.460]And it’s not too long before you point it out
[01:17.880]I cannot cry
[01:20.270]Because I know that’s weakness in your eyes
[01:24.660]I’m forced to fake
[01:27.200]A smile, a laugh, every day of my life
[01:31.440]My heart can’t possibly break
[01:34.000]When it wasn’t even whole to start with
[01:38.550]Because of you
[01:40.190]I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[01:45.310]Because of you
[01:46.830]I learned to play on the safe side
[01:48.380]so I don’t get hurt
[01:52.040]Because of you
[01:53.670]I find it hard to trust not only me,
[01:56.380]but everyone around me
[01:59.090]Because of you I am afraid
[02:06.650]I watched you die
[02:08.590]I heard you cry every night in your sleep
[02:13.470]I was so young
[02:15.070]You should have known better than to lean on me
[02:20.230]You never thought of anyone else
[02:23.680]You just saw your pain
[02:27.120]And now I cry in the middle of the night
[02:30.910]For the same damn thing
[02:36.840]Because of you I never stray
[02:38.380]too far from the sidewalk
[02:43.690]Because of you I learned to play on the safe
[02:48.380]side so I don’t get hurt
[02:50.750]Because of you
[02:52.180]I try my hardest just to forget everything
[02:57.370]Because of you
[02:58.940]I don’t know how to let anyone else in
[03:04.180]Because of you
[03:06.230]I’m ashamed of my life because it’s empty
[03:11.130]Because of you I am afraid
[03:18.360]Because of you
