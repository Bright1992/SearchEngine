[ti:because of you]
[ar:kelly clarkson]
[00:15.97]I  will  not  make  the  same  mistakes  that  you  did
[00:21.84]I  will  not  let  myself  cause  my  heart  so  much  misery
[00:29.95]I  will  not  break  the  way  you  did
[00:34.34]You  fell  so  hard
[00:36.87]I  learned  the  hard  way  to  never  let  it  get  that  far
[00:43.99]Because  of  you
[00:45.61]I  never  stray  too  far  from  the  sidewalk
[00:50.80]Because  of  you
[00:52.32]I  learned  to  play  on  the  safe  side
[00:54.62]So  I  don't  get  hurt
[00:57.59]Because  of  you
[00:59.43]I  find  it  hard  to  trust
[01:00.99]Not  only  me  but  everyone  around  me
[01:05.07]Because  of  you
[01:08.44]I  am  afraid
[01:13.76]I  lose  my  way
[01:16.33]And  it's  not  too  long  before  you  point  it  out
[01:20.72]I  cannot  cry
[01:23.67]Because  I  know  that's  weakness  in  your  eyes
[01:27.60]I'm  forced  to  fake  a  smile  a  laugh
[01:32.32]Every  day  of  my  life
[01:34.65]My  heart  can't  possibly  break
[01:37.30]When  it  wasn't  even  whole  to  start  with
[01:41.67]Because  of  you
[01:43.47]I  never  stray  too  far  from  the  sidewalk
[01:48.78]Because  of  you
[01:50.28]I  learned  to  play  on  the  safe  side
[01:52.53]So  I  don't  get  hurt
[01:55.62]Because  of  you
[01:57.19]I  find  it  hard  to  trust
[01:58.84]Not  only  me  but  everyone  around  me
[02:02.70]Because  of  you
[02:06.25]I  am  afraid
[02:09.73]I  watched  you  die
[02:11.38]I  heard  you  cry
[02:13.13]Every  night  in  your  sleep
[02:16.65]I  was  so  young
[02:18.27]You  should  have  known  better  than  to  lean  on  me
[02:23.58]You  never  thought  of  anyone  else
[02:26.96]You  just  saw  your  pain
[02:30.42]And  now  I  cry
[02:32.12]In  the  middle  of  the  night
[02:34.35]Over  the  same  damn  thing
[02:41.20]Because  of  you
[02:42.65]I  never  stray  too  far  from  the  sidewalk
[02:48.38]Because  of  you
[02:49.80]I  learned  to  play  on  the  safe  side
[02:52.07]So  I  don't  get  hurt
[02:55.08]Because  of  you
[02:56.68]I  find  it  hard  to  trust
[02:58.51]Not  only  me  but  everyone  around  me
[03:02.49]Because  of  you
[03:07.29]I  am  afraid
