[00:00.00] 作词 : COLLINGWOOD, CHRIS/SCHLESINGER, ADAM
[00:05.920]I used to know you when we were young
[00:20.360]You were in all my dreams
[00:22.470]We sat together in period one
[00:29.690]Fridays at 8:15
[00:33.740]Now I see your face in the strangest places
[00:36.900]Movies and magazines
[00:42.040]I saw you talkin to Christopher Walken
[00:45.100]On my TV screen
[00:50.350]But I will wait for you
[00:53.850]As long as I need to
[00:56.250]And if you ever get back to Hackensack
[00:59.750]I ll be here for you
[01:04.460]I used to work in a record store
[01:19.110]Now I work for my dad
[01:23.160]Scraping the paint off of hard wood floors
[01:27.320]The hours are pretty bad
[01:31.360]Sometimes I wonder where you are
[01:34.480]Probably in L.A.
[01:40.050]That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days
[01:46.480]But I will wait for you
[01:52.610]As long as I need to
[01:56.410]And if you ever get back to Hackensack
[02:00.370]I ll be here for you
[02:22.800]And I will wait for you
[02:24.760]As long as I need to
[02:30.010]And if you ever get back to Hackensack
[02:33.590]I ll be here for you
[02:38.730]If you ever get back to Hackensack
[02:43.650]I ll be here for you
