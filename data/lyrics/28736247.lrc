[00:25.62]I can see my baby swingin'
[00:33.65]I can see my baby swingin'
[00:42.19]I can see my baby swingin'
[00:50.19]I can see my baby swingin'
[00:58.18]Down on the West Coast they got a sayin'
[01:02.12]"If you're not drinkin' then you're not playin'."
[01:05.52]But you've got the music, you've got the music
[01:09.81]In you, don't you?
[01:14.54]Down on the West Coast I get this feeling like
[01:18.69]It all could happen that's why I'm leaving
[01:22.03]You for the moment, you for the moment
[01:26.37]Boy Blue, yeah you
[01:48.15]I can see my baby swingin'
[01:56.39]I can see my baby swingin'
[02:04.76]Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
[02:08.75]Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigon
[02:12.24]And you've got the music, you've got the music
[02:16.38]In you, don't you?
[02:21.39]Down on the West Coast, they love their movies
[02:25.17]Their golden gods and rock and roll groupies
[02:28.86]And you've got the music, you've got the music
[02:32.66]In you, don't you?
[02:37.75]I can see my baby swingin'
[02:46.02]I can see my baby swingin'
[03:27.20]You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
[03:30.50]I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
[03:34.98]Te deseo, cari?o, boy, it's you I desire
[03:38.93]Your love, your love, our love
