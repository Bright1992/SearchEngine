[00:06.250]Close my eyes and feel your mind
[00:10.910]Time has passed
[00:13.120]I walk like a shadow
[00:15.660]Never knew what I am going through
[00:20.580]You touch my heart and take my breath away
[00:26.200]Whisper on the wind so softly
[00:31.300]Let the bright stars fill our dreams with love
[00:36.580]Reach for your hand (You're holding my key)
[00:39.900]And you show me the way
[00:46.400]Tonight, I feel close to you
[00:50.870]You open my door and light the sky above
[00:57.200]When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
[01:02.100]I wish we could stay as one
[01:07.300]I wish we could stay forever as one
[01:17.960]All the tears that haunt my past
[01:22.950]You promised it'll be better tomorrow
[01:28.630]Play that song
[01:30.400]You and I listened to
[01:33.390]And let it gently ease our pain
[01:38.730]Tender rain drops from the blue skyaa
[01:44.029]Flowers blooming, life is so divine
[01:49.000]Like sunlight on a stream (You're holding my key)
[01:51.470]You show the world to me
[01:59.220]Tonight, I feel close to you
[02:03.690]You open my door and light the sky above
[02:09.938]When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
[02:15.160]I wish we could stay as one
[02:21.150]So much love in this beautiful world
[02:25.800]Search for the brightest star in the sky
[02:31.180]You will find the meaning of love
[02:36.300]Don't be afraid (Don't be afraid)
[02:38.710]Just be yourself (Just be yourself)
[02:45.270]We need this love... I've never knew
[03:07.800]Tonight, I feel close you
[03:15.250]You open my door and light the sky above
[03:19.880]When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
[03:25.190]I wish we could stay as one
[03:30.500]Tonight, I feel close to you
[03:35.500]You open my door and light the sky above
[03:41.400]When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
[03:46.860]I wish we could stay as one
[03:51.200]I wish we could stay forever as one
