[00:07.710]Let's light it up, let's light it up
[00:09.810]Until our hearts catch fire
[00:15.350]And so the world, a burning light
[00:17.320]They've never shined so bright
[00:22.010]We'll find a way, we'll find a way
[00:24.870]To keep the cold night
[00:26.810]From breaking in over the walls
[00:29.000]Into the wild side
[00:32.080]The hunger satisfies
[00:38.270]We're burning up
[00:41.610]We might as well be lovers on the sun
[00:49.960]We might as well be lovers on the sun
[00:57.200]We might as well be lovers on the sun
[01:36.250]We'll never know, we'll never know
[01:37.960]What stands behind the North
[01:43.550]But I got a feeling
[01:45.050]It's a feeling that's we're dying for
[01:51.170]Just close your eyes, and hold your breath
[01:53.350]Because it feels right
[01:55.220]We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side
[02:01.360]And let's enjoy the ride
[02:06.540]We're burning up
[02:10.140]We might as well be lovers on the sun
[02:17.670]We might as well be lovers on the sun
[02:25.300]We might as well be lovers on the sun
[03:02.810]Let's light it up, let's light it up
[03:04.410]Until our hearts catch fire
[03:10.010]And so the world, a burning light
[03:12.200]They've never shined so bright
