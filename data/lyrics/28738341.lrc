[00:08.100]How do I say goodbye to what we had?
[00:13.100]The good times that made us laugh
[00:18.280]Outweigh the bad.
[00:24.810]I thought we'd get to see forever
[00:31.360]But forever's gone away
[00:37.870]It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.
[00:50.690]I don't know where this road
[00:57.480]Is going to lead
[01:03.530]All I know is where we've been
[01:09.570]And what we've been through.
[01:16.070]If we get to see tomorrow
[01:22.800]I hope it's worth all the wait
[01:28.890]It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.
[01:41.670]And I'll take with me the memories
[01:48.530]To be my sunshine after the rain
[01:54.880]It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.
[02:07.570]And I'll take with me the memories
[02:14.310]To be my sunshine after the rain
[02:23.670]It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.
[02:36.150]It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.
