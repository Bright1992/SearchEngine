[03:10.870]You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
[03:13.950]Damn, okay, from that perspective
[03:15.880]I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
[03:18.680]Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
[03:21.070]But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
[03:22.740]Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
[03:26.300]But when they need a favor, who do they call?
[03:28.310]Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
[03:31.680]Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
[03:34.420]They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
[03:37.080]These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
[03:39.190]Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
[03:41.220]I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
[03:43.200]Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
[03:45.980]No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
[03:47.900]Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
[03:51.170]They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
[03:54.030]Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
[03:56.940]Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
[03:59.710]We already got spring 2015 poppin'
[04:02.380]PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
[04:04.550]Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
[04:07.850]Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
[04:10.430]Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
[04:13.150]Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
[04:16.000]And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
[04:18.820]Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
[04:21.290]Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
[04:23.400]Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
