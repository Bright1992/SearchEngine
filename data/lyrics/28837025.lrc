[00:11.38]Woke up a little late today
[00:13.73]Lookin' at the clouds of gray
[00:16.19]Got numerous phone calls from you
[00:20.22]
[00:20.93]Still your picture by my bed
[00:23.26]Still the one I want instead
[00:25.74]But I can't find a way to say
[00:29.45]Come back (Come back)
[00:32.40]You make up my life
[00:34.42]My pride has left me all alone
[00:38.14]
[00:38.59]It's gettin' so cold
[00:40.83]I'm closing the windows to stay warm
[00:45.62]It's chillin' my soul since you've been gone
[00:50.39]This silence is louder than any thunder
[00:55.27]Taken me under ohhhh
[00:59.20]I'm stayin' home today
[01:03.54]Gonna hide away
[01:06.57]
[01:08.06]Cause it feels like rain
[01:13.81]Do you know what it feels like
[01:16.04]Do you know what it feels like
[01:18.43]Do you know what it feels like
[01:20.93]When it feels like rain?
[01:23.43]
[01:23.98]Everyday just seems the same
[01:25.76]And I'm the only one to blame
[01:28.17]I try to play like I'm fine
[01:31.93]
[01:32.91]Now the pain is here to stay
[01:35.28]The love has washed away
[01:37.68]It falls and runs down the drain
[01:41.56]Come back (Come back)
[01:44.35]You make up my life
[01:46.31]My pride has left me all alone
[01:50.35]It's gettin' so cold
[01:52.15]I'm closing the windows to stay warm
[01:57.57]It's chillin' my soul since you've been gone
[02:02.44]This silence is louder than any thunder
[02:07.46]Taken me under ohhhh
[02:10.85]I'm stayin' home today
[02:15.52]Gonna hide away
[02:19.17]
[02:19.98]Cause it feels like rain
[02:26.14]At some point (Some point)
[02:28.39]This darkness (Darkness)
[02:30.96]Is bound to fade Today (Today)
[02:35.55]It's so hard (So hard) to believe (Believe)
[02:40.48]This storm will ever blow away
[02:44.98]
[02:45.65]I'm closing the windows to stay warm
[02:50.39]It's chillin' my soul since you've been gone
[02:55.15]This silence is louder than any thunder
[03:00.12]Taken me under ohhhh
[03:03.69]I'm stayin' home today
[03:08.27]Gonna hide away
[03:12.07]
[03:12.76]Cause it feels like rain
[03:18.58]Do you know what it feels like
[03:20.91]Do you know what it feels like
[03:23.27]Do you know what it feels like
[03:25.91]It feels like rain.
[03:28.11]
[03:28.66]Do you know what it feels like
[03:30.49]Do you know what it feels like
[03:32.85]Do you know what it feels like
[03:35.56]When it feels like rain?
[03:38.46]
