[00:15.00]Kiss my lips and taste the Sauvignon
[00:18.92]
[00:20.15]I wrap the vines around your thighs
[00:23.29]
[00:25.67]I can see the kind of tip you're on
[00:29.16]
[00:30.96]There's no confusion in your eyes
[00:34.46]
[00:36.19]Let's unwind together
[00:41.72]
[00:43.80]Together
[00:44.38]
[00:47.11]Ease our minds together
[00:52.58]
[00:54.77]Together
[00:55.78]
[00:59.11]Taking sips to push the moment on
[01:01.75]
[01:04.19]But it's just the bottle that's run dry
[01:07.93]
[01:10.17]Lose the watch cause we got nothing on
[01:13.19]
[01:15.42]And I'm not keeping track of time!
[01:18.72]
[01:20.33]Let's unwind together
[01:26.32]
[01:27.79]Together
[01:28.87]
[01:31.17]Ease our minds together
[01:37.30]
[01:38.89]Together
[01:39.99]
[01:41.75]Together
[01:42.25]
[01:44.32]Together
[01:45.04]
[01:47.14]Together
[01:48.17]
[01:53.41]Ease our minds together
[01:59.16]
[02:00.89]Together
[02:01.60]
[02:03.65]Together
[02:04.31]
[02:06.38]Together
[02:07.13]
[02:09.40]Together
[02:10.99]
[02:11.94]Together
[02:12.61]
[02:14.68]Together
[02:15.32]
[02:17.53]Together
[02:18.87]
