[00:14.08]I don't ever ask you where you've been
[00:20.21]And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
[00:26.18]I can't even think straight, but I can tell
[00:32.31]That you were just with her
[00:35.04]And I'll still be a fool
[00:41.92]I'm a fool for you
[00:50.95]Just a little bit of your heart
[00:54.14]Just a little bit of your heart
[00:57.00]Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
[01:02.95]Just a little bit of your heart
[01:06.07]Just a little bit of your heart
[01:09.41]Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
[01:28.01]I don't ever tell you how I really feel
[01:33.95]Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
[01:39.99]And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say
[01:46.24]I know I'm not your only
[01:52.51]But I'll still be a fool
[01:55.51]Cause I'm a fool for you
[02:04.49]Just a little bit of your heart
[02:08.15]Just a little bit of your heart
[02:10.98]Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
[02:17.01]Just a little bit of your heart
[02:20.07]Just a little bit of your heart
[02:23.24]Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
[02:33.59](Just a little bit)
[02:38.14](Mmm, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
[02:41.89]I know I'm not your only
[02:44.35]But at least I'm one
[02:47.47]I heard a little love
[02:50.95]Is better than none
[02:54.60](Oh, babe)
[02:57.59]Just a little bit of your heart
[03:00.05]Just a little bit of your heart
[03:03.13]Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
[03:09.22]Just a little bit of your heart
[03:12.28]Just a little bit of your heart
[03:15.45]Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
[03:22.03]Just a little bit of your heart
[03:24.55]Just a little bit of your heart
[03:27.56]Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
[03:33.55]Just a little bit of your heart (just a little bit)
[03:37.16]Just a little bit of your heart
[03:40.06]Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
[03:46.81]
