[00:13.310]You and me we made a vow
[00:18.840]For better or for worse
[00:24.810]I can't believe you let me down
[00:28.720]But the proof is in the way it hurts
[00:36.400]For months on end I've had my doubts
[00:42.280]Denying every tear
[00:48.180]I wish this would be over now
[00:52.170]But I know that I still need you here
[00:57.780]You say I'm crazy
[01:04.170]Cause you don't think I know what you've done
[01:09.550]But when you call me baby
[01:15.930]I know I'm not the only one
[01:23.350]You've been so unfaithful
[01:29.230]Now sadly I know why
[01:34.870]Your heart is unobtainable
[01:38.770]Even though doesn't know share mine
[01:44.680]You say I'm crazy
[01:50.770]Cause you don't think I know what you've done
[01:56.430]But when you call me baby
[02:02.690]I know I'm not the only one
[02:09.600]I have loved you for many years
[02:14.980]Maybe I am just not enough
[02:20.930]You've made me realise my deepest fear
[02:26.080]By lying and tearing us up
[02:31.560]You say I'm crazy
[02:37.920]Cause you don't think I know what you've done
[02:43.190]But when you call me baby
[02:49.590]I know I'm not the only one
[02:55.140]You say I'm crazy
[03:01.420]Cause you don't think I know what you've done
[03:06.970]But when you call me baby
[03:13.070]I know I'm not the only one
