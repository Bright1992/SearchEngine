[00:11.560]Waiting here for my phone to ring, phone to ring
[00:17.350]Are you ever coming back to me again?
[00:22.040]Counting every drop-ling, drop-ling falling
[00:27.550]Falling down into the hole you dug for me
[00:32.490]And it buried me, 'cause you dug so deep
[00:40.550]But I'm still within your reach
[00:49.130]Oh, oh
[00:52.120]If you really love me, you would let me go, oh
[00:57.150]I'm tired of always sleeping with your ghost
[01:03.920]Chasing away the things I need the most
[01:11.300]If you really love me, you would let me go
[01:14.760]If you love me, let me go
[01:22.010]Every time you come back again, back again
[01:24.470]The healing ends
[01:27.470]I push all of my rules aside for you
[01:32.490]You should see the way other eyes, other eyes
[01:36.530]Fight for me
[01:38.230]They give me everything that you never do
[01:42.870]Still it tears at me
[01:46.900]Cause you cut so deep
[01:51.150]And I'm still within your reach
[01:56.910]Oh, oh
[01:59.520]If you really love me, you would let me go, oh
[02:04.510]I'm tired of always sleeping with your ghost
[02:07.810]Chasing away the things I need the most
[02:12.830]If you really love me, you would let me go
[02:22.250]If you love me, let me go
[02:27.110]All of me, all of me
[02:29.680]Wants to be with you, but you
[02:30.530]Let me bleed, let me bleed
[02:35.290]All of me, all of me
[02:40.260]Wants to be with you, but you
[02:41.100]Let me bleed, let me bleed
[02:45.740]Oh, oh
[02:48.270]If you really love me, you would let me go, oh
[02:53.460]I'm tired of always sleeping with your ghost
[02:59.530]Chasing away the things I need the most
[03:04.270]If you really love me, you would let me go
[03:11.360]If you love me, let me go
[03:16.650]If you love me, let me go
