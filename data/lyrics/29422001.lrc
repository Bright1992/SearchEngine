[00:32.00]In the darkness
[00:35.84]Before the dawn
[00:41.45]In the swelling
[00:45.24]Of this storm
[00:49.57]Running round and with apologies
[00:54.84]And hope is gone
[00:56.82]Leave a light, a light on
[02:11.92]Millions are
[02:15.64]Lost from home
[02:21.39]In the swelling
[02:24.79]Swelling on
[02:27.56]Running round and with a thunder
[02:32.60]To bleed from thorns
[02:34.78]Leave a light, a light on
[02:42.39]Leave a light, a light on
