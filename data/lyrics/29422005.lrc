[00:57.920]Didn't I warn you not to?
[01:02.410]Didn't I warn you good?
[01:07.010]Maybe we couldn't help it
[01:12.000]Maybe we never should
[01:26.360]Didn't I say it slowly?
[01:31.290]Didn't I make it clear?
[01:35.920]Is it unfair to ask you?
[01:40.750]Why it is you're still here?
[01:45.560]You cut your teeth,
[01:47.680]on the lack of answers, singing
[01:50.790]Come back home,
[01:51.990]and it don't feel the same
[01:54.730]Well I've bled words onto a page for you
[01:59.350]And you never knew my name
[03:02.600]Didn't I make it harder?
[03:07.350]Didn't I leave you that?
[03:11.960]Was it too much to ask you?
[03:16.660]Why it is you still care?
[03:21.620]You cut your teeth,
[03:23.560]on the lack of answers,
[03:25.930]singing
[03:26.770]Come back home,
[03:28.010]and it don't feel the same
[03:30.590]Well I've bled words onto a page for you
[03:35.430]And you never knew my name
[04:38.570]You cut your teeth ,
[04:40.310]on the lack of answers,
[04:42.470]singing
[04:43.590]Come back home,
[04:44.870]and it don't feel the same
[04:47.390]Well I've bled words onto a page for you
[04:52.230]And you never knew my name
