[01:07.080]this is to end in fire
[01:09.580]Then we should all burn together
[01:12.030]Watch the flames climb high into the night
[01:16.830]Calling out father, oh,
[01:19.470]Stand by and we will
[01:21.650]Watch the flames burn auburn on
[01:24.380]The mountain side high
[01:35.800]And if we should die tonight
[01:38.460]We should all die together
[01:40.840]Raise a glass of wine for the last time
[01:45.570]Calling out father, oh,
[01:48.350]Prepare as we will
[01:50.490]Watch the flames burn auburn on
[01:53.000]The mountain side
[01:55.220]Desolation comes upon the sky
[01:59.780]Now I see fire
[02:02.550]Inside the mountain
[02:04.920]I see fire
[02:07.510]Burning the trees
[02:09.650]And I see fire
[02:12.340]Hollowing souls
[02:14.490]I see fire
[02:17.150]Blood in the breeze
[02:19.370]And I hope that you remember me
[03:02.210]Oh, should my people fall in
[03:04.980]Surely I'll do the same
[03:06.740]Confined in mountain halls
[03:09.590]We got too close to the flame
[03:12.090]Calling out father, oh,
[03:14.590]Hold fast and we will
[03:16.890]Watch the flames burn auburn on
[03:19.360]The mountain side
[03:21.750]Desolation comes upon the sky
[03:26.470]Now I see fire
[03:28.920]Inside the mountain
[03:31.250]I see fire
[03:33.730]Burning the trees
[03:36.040]And I see fire
[03:38.580]Hollowing souls
[03:40.830]And I see fire
[03:43.410]Blood in the breeze
[03:45.740]And I hope that you remember me
[04:28.590]Now I see fire
[04:31.550]Inside the mountains
[04:33.600]I see fire
[04:36.150]Burning the trees
[04:38.420]And I see fire
[04:40.990]Hollowing souls
[04:43.280]And I see fire
[04:45.710]Blood in the breeze
[04:48.340]And I hope that you remember me
