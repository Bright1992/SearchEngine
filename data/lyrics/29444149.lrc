[00:09.02]Someone left your heart shattered
[00:11.15]Someone brought you home flowers
[00:13.33]You fell off of that ladder but you've got the power
[00:17.64]To get back up when you're feeling not okay and you don't know
[00:22.06]Shine a light in your shadows, you're not alone cause
[00:26.40]Everybody's been broken, everybody's been down
[00:30.75]Keep the floodgates open, let it all out, yeah

[00:48.12]Every tear can put out a fire, every tear can put out a fire
[00:52.49]Every tear can put out a fire, every tear can put out a fire
[00:56.80]Every tear can put out a fire
[00:59.84]So let them fall, so let them fall, so let them fall
[01:20.74]Standing there in your white dress
[01:22.92]Trapped alone with your secrets
[01:25.10]Wanting all that you can't get
[01:27.23]This power and this weakness
[01:29.45]Fall in love with your downfalls
[01:31.57]Make the best of your bad calls
[01:33.76]Throw regret out the window
[01:35.94]You're not alone cause
[01:38.12]Everybody's been broken, everybody's been down
[01:42.42]Keep the floodgates open, let it all out, cause

[01:51.08]Every tear can put out a fire, every tear can put out a fire
[01:55.45]Every tear can put out a fire, every tear can put out a fire
[01:59.80]Every tear can put out a fire
[02:03.31]So let them fall, so let them fall, so let them fall
