[00:06.440]So much pressure
[00:08.150]Why so loud?
[00:09.600]If you don't like my sound
[00:11.140]You can turn it down
[00:12.340]I gotta go
[00:15.370]And I'm walking alone
[00:20.050]Uphill battle
[00:21.290]I look good when I got it
[00:22.940]I'm ferocious but cautious
[00:24.440]I get doses... not gonna stop
[00:28.480]I like the view from the top
[00:32.720]They talk that blah blah
[00:34.060]That blah blah, that blah blah sh*t
[00:36.110]And I'm so done, I'm so over it
[00:39.350]Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I hit and miss
[00:42.940]But I'm okay, I'm cool with this
[00:46.630]I still fall on my face sometimes
[00:49.670]And I can't color inside the lines
[00:52.920]Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
[00:56.500]I'm still working on my masterpiece
[00:59.640]And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
[01:02.970]Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
[01:06.120]No, you haven't seen the best of me
[01:09.710]I'm still working on my masterpiece
[01:26.110]Don't mind, don't mind
[01:27.700]Those who matter, don't mind
[01:29.150]If you don't catch what I'm throwing
[01:30.740]Then I leave you behind
[01:32.180]Don't need a flash
[01:34.980]And I am leaving like that
[01:39.110]They talk that blah blah
[01:40.460]That blah blah, that blah blah sh*t
[01:41.970]Go with the punches, and take the hits
[01:45.650]Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I swing and miss
[01:49.230]But it's okay, I'm cool with this
[01:52.980]I still fall on my face sometimes
[01:56.010]And I can't color inside the lines
[01:59.300]Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
[02:02.790]I'm still working on my masterpiece
[02:06.020]And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
[02:09.420]Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
[02:12.550]No, you haven't seen the best of me
[02:15.950]I'm still working on my masterpiece
[02:32.840]I still fall on my face sometimes
[02:35.720]And I can't color inside the lines
[02:38.970]Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
[02:42.660]I'm still working on my masterpiece
[02:45.950]Masterpiece, masterpiece
[02:49.690]I still fall on my face sometimes
[02:52.390]And I can't color inside the lines
[02:55.620]Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
[02:59.350]I'm still working on my masterpiece
[03:02.390]And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
[03:05.830]Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
[03:08.870]No, you haven't seen the best of me
[03:12.550]I'm still working on my masterpiece
