[00:04.93]Stick, and stones, shattered bones
[00:06.84]But in the end they always heal
[00:08.99]Take a sip, make a joke
[00:11.09]Turn on the pain, but this is real
[00:13.49]Every time I look in the mirror
[00:15.49]All your words I keep on hearing
[00:18.98]Are tearing me apart
[00:21.68]Open names, sweeter games
[00:23.83]What you did behind my back
[00:26.10]Memories echoing
[00:28.10]Making sense, now playing back
[00:30.26]Every time I look in the mirror
[00:32.45]All your words I keep on hearing
[00:35.97]I think you might've said too much
[00:40.23]Sorry isn't good enough
[00:44.58]I thought that
[00:45.33]You would call this love, love
[00:49.98]No, you can't take it back
[00:52.60]I think you might've said too much
[00:57.27]Then you really messed me up
[01:01.43]I thought that
[01:02.23]You would call this love, love
[01:06.98]No, you can't take it back
[01:09.53]But I think
[01:10.21]You might've said too much
[01:14.80]I can't glue back broken glasses
[01:18.98]But I can fix what you were smashing
[01:23.40]Don't apologize again
[01:25.35]I won't make a frozen bet
[01:29.27]No, no, no
[01:31.89]Stick, and stones, shattered bones
[01:33.89]But in the end they always heal
[01:35.99]All the lies, you crossed the lines
[01:38.14]You showed me how you really do
[01:40.34]Every time I look your way
[01:42.44]I can see my future clearer
[01:46.20]I think you might've said too much
[01:50.32]Sorry isn't good enough
[01:54.42]I thought that
[01:55.05]You would call this love, love
[02:00.07]No, you can't take it back
[02:02.89]I think you might've said too much
[02:07.42]Then you really messed me up
[02:11.43]I thought that
[02:12.33]You would call this love, love
[02:17.15]No, you can't take it back
[02:19.58]But I think
[02:20.50]You might've said too much
[02:22.65]Why you took it all the way?
[02:24.81]Why you took it all the way?
[02:26.03]Tell me why
[02:28.18]Passed the point of no return
[02:31.16]Why you took it all the way?
[02:33.21]Why you took it all the way?
[02:34.55]Tell me why
[02:36.50]Passed the point of no return
[02:39.83]Why you took it all the way?
[02:41.68]Why you took it all the way?
[02:43.06]Took it all the way
[02:45.20]Passed the point of no return
[02:48.32]Why you took it all the way?
[02:50.41]Why you took it all the way?
[02:54.06]I think you might've said too much
[02:58.39]Sorry isn't good enough
[03:02.45]I thought that
[03:03.22]You would call this love, love
[03:08.07]No, you can't take it back
[03:10.97]I think you might've said too much
[03:15.36]Then you really messed me up
[03:19.37]I thought that
[03:20.27]You would call this love, love
[03:25.02]No, you can't take it back
[03:27.77]But I think you might've said too much
