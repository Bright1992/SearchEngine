[00:17.89]How can we live in the darkness
[00:21.06]and turn our backs to all the silent pain
[00:26.44]that no one wants to notice
[00:30.21]Why is it hard to be caring
[00:33.26]Why is it hard to lend a helping hand
[00:38.08]with descency and kindness
[00:42.64]is this a world without a soul
[00:47.76]Falling in a big black hole
[00:51.64]Here comes the flood
[00:56.73]Why don't anybody seem to understand
[01:03.05]Here comes the flood
[01:08.61]Cleaning up the mess we made the best it can
[01:16.02]......
[01:42.51]Take a long look at the children
[01:45.27]without a chance to ever live a life
[01:50.29]that's free of hurt and hunger
[01:54.19]Who's gonna give me an answer
[01:57.27]Who's gonna show that we can stop the tide
[02:02.39]For future generation
[02:06.77]Who's gonna ride the open wave
[02:12.30]Rebuild the ark and save the day
[02:15.74]Here comes the flood
[02:20.65]Why don't anybody seem to understand
[02:27.59]Here comes the flood
[02:32.57]Cleaning up the mess we made the best it can
[02:40.06]......
[02:51.92]Here comes the flood
[03:28.49]End
