[00:31.540]Same bed but it feels just
[00:33.970]A little bit bigger now
[00:37.020]
[00:39.850]Our song on the radio
[00:42.030]
[00:42.910]But it don't sound the same
[00:45.870]
[00:48.220]When our friends talk about you
[00:50.600]
[00:51.390]is just tear me down
[00:54.810]
[00:56.650]Cause my heart breaks a little
[00:58.790]
[00:59.660]When I hear your name
[01:01.750]
[01:02.270]It all just sounds like oooooh
[01:09.870]
[01:11.990]Mmm too young too dumb to realize
[01:18.550]I should've bought you flowers
[01:21.500]
[01:23.490]And held your hand
[01:25.250]
[01:26.620]Gave you all my hours
[01:30.370]
[01:31.290]When I had the chance
[01:33.640]
[01:34.950]Take you to every party
[01:37.620]Cause all you wanted to do was dance
[01:42.040]
[01:42.960]Now my baby is dancing
[01:45.890]
[01:47.170]with another man
[01:49.890]
[01:53.160]My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
[01:58.730]
[02:01.190]Caused a good strong person
[02:03.250]like you to walk out my life
[02:06.760]
[02:09.170]Now I never never never
[02:11.090]get to clean up the mess I made
[02:15.410]
[02:17.210]And it hunts me every time I close my eyes
[02:22.660]It all just sounds like oooooh
[02:30.750]
[02:32.480]Mmm too young too dumb to realize
[02:38.780]I should've bought you flowers
[02:41.650]
[02:43.610]And held your hand
[02:45.410]
[02:46.830]Gave you all my hours
[02:50.440]
[02:51.280]When I had the chance
[02:53.150]
[02:54.800]Take you to every party
[02:57.510]Cause all you wanted to do was dance
[03:02.160]
[03:03.090]Now my baby is dancing
[03:05.910]
[03:07.350]With another man
[03:10.210]
[03:11.770]Although it hurts
[03:14.640]
[03:15.720]I'll be the first to say
[03:20.320]I was wrong
[03:25.800]
[03:28.420]I know I'm probably much too late
[03:31.220]
[03:32.090]To apologize for my mistakes
[03:35.390]
[03:36.110]But you must know
[03:39.410]

[03:58.050]Take you to every party
[04:00.800]Cause I remember you loved to dance
[04:05.280]
[04:06.240]Do all the things I should've done
[04:09.250]
[04:10.660]When I was your man
[04:13.210]
[04:14.270]Do all the things I should've done
[04:17.410]
[04:18.770]When I was your man
