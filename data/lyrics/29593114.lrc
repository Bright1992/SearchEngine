[00:00.310]Always running from what feels right
[00:03.090]To fast, and I didn't know
[00:07.370]Then a minute toss the daylight
[00:10.470]You're here, no way to let go
[00:13.860]Don't look back, when you're holding me
[00:21.370]Cause I know what this love was meant to be
[00:29.490]One day we're gonna wake up together
[00:35.020]You won't wanna go home
[00:38.860]We'll find love here together
[00:42.170]And it feels so good in my arms
[00:46.540]We're gonna wake up together
[00:50.130]You won't wanna go home
[00:53.810]We'll find love here forever
[00:57.300]Cause we'll wake up together
[01:14.330]I got something and it feels right
[01:17.880]Would I need to be
[01:19.820]You control what you feel for me
[01:22.650]I was watching you the whole night
[01:25.340]I can never explain how a magical blaze
[01:29.520]Don't look back, when you're holding me
[01:36.340]Cause I know what this love was meant to be
[01:44.020]One day we're gonna wake up together
[01:50.360]You won't wanna go home
[01:54.090]We'll find love here together
[01:57.370]And it feels so good in my arms
[02:01.550]We're gonna wake up together
[02:04.990]You won't wanna go home
[02:09.270]We'll find love here forever
[02:12.400]Cause we'll wake up together
[02:29.520]One day
[02:42.430]And it feels so good in my arms
[02:50.050]You won't wanna go home
[02:57.540]Cause we'll wake up together
