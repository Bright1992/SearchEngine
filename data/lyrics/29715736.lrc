[00:17.930]I let it fall, my heart,
[00:21.490]And as it fell you rose to claim it.
[00:26.230]It was dark and I was over,
[00:30.350]Until you kissed my lips and you saved me.
[00:35.040]My hands they're strong, but my knees were far too weak, to
[00:44.150]stand in your arms without falling to your feet,
[00:52.750]But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew.
[00:57.310]All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
[01:01.770]And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win.
[01:09.790]But I set fire to the rain,
[01:14.670]Watched it pour as I touched your face,
[01:19.190]well, it burned while I cried,
[01:21.280]Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
[01:29.410]It might not be the right time
[01:33.750]I might not be the right one
[01:37.660]But there's something about us I want to say
[01:41.830]Cause there's something between us anyway.
[01:46.360]When I lay with you I could stay there,
[01:53.120]Close my eyes, feel you here forever,
[01:59.170]You and me together, nothing is better!
[02:04.150]Cause there's a side to you that I never, never knew,
[02:08.620]All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
[02:12.990]And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win.
[02:20.920]But I set fire to the rain,
[02:25.750]Watched it pour as I touched your face,
[02:30.260]well, it burned while I cried,
[02:32.150]Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
[02:40.510]I need you more than anything in my life
[02:44.690]I want you more than anything in my life
[02:49.030]I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
[02:53.420]I love you more than anyone in my life
