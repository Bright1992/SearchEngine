[00:10.060]Do you ever think of me, when you lie
[00:14.890]Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
[00:20.920]And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
[00:26.100]They only pretend, you would be mine
[00:32.540]And you know how you made me, believe
[00:37.590]You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
[00:43.120]But do you ever think of me, when you lie
[00:48.150]Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
[00:55.290]You could never make eye contact
[00:57.730]Everything you got was based off of my contacts
[01:00.520]You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
[01:03.120]Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap
[01:06.410]You was caught up in the rush
[01:07.750]and you was caught up in the thrill of it
[01:09.350]You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
[01:12.040]Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
[01:14.740]I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it
[01:17.890]I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
[01:20.530]Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
[01:23.430]Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
[01:26.080]Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
[01:29.110]They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
[01:32.310]They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
[01:34.950]But there was something that I should've asked all along
[01:38.340]I'mma ask on the song
[01:39.390]Do you ever think of me, when you lie
[01:43.930]Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
[01:50.030]And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
[01:55.120]They only pretend, you would be mine
[02:01.660]And you know how you made me, believe
[02:06.770]You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
[02:12.250]But do you ever think of me, when you lie
[02:17.320]Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
[02:24.150]I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
[02:26.950]You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
[02:29.690]I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
[02:32.420]But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
[02:35.220]I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
[02:37.920]What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
[02:40.710]When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em
[02:43.640]If you had a heart, I was hoping you would show it some
[02:46.500]What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me
[02:49.250]I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
[02:52.040]I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
[02:54.840]This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
[02:58.680]They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
[03:01.480]They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
[03:04.480]But there was something that I should've asked, all along
[03:07.670]I'mma ask on the song
[03:08.670]So does she know I've been in that bed before
[03:15.390]A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth
[03:21.050]If I was just another girl
[03:26.240]Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
[03:31.240]There's one thing I need to know
[03:33.990]So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself
[03:42.050]Do you ever think of me, when you lie
[03:46.890]Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
[03:52.940]And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
[03:57.970]They only pretend, you would be mine
[04:04.520]And you know how you made me, believe
[04:09.600]You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
[04:15.040]But do you ever think of me, when you lie
[04:20.130]Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
