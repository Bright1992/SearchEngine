[00:06.59]You sit there stone-faced
[00:08.25]
[00:09.48]as if I'm not here
[00:11.01]
[00:11.87]Can't you see
[00:12.86]that I've been crying?
[00:15.50]
[00:17.63]I didn't know you'd be insane
[00:21.36]
[00:22.73]Dreams can be so deceiving
[00:26.21]
[00:28.14]You're an itch I can't reach
[00:29.85]
[00:31.35]A wound that won't heal
[00:32.60]
[00:33.48]The smell of skin, that's burning
[00:37.17]
[00:39.03]I didn't know you'd be insane
[00:42.94]
[00:43.97]But it's true
[00:44.74]
[00:45.26]And just say all I am to you
[00:48.71]
[00:49.43]is a pain in my neck
[00:51.69]
[00:52.52]Thorn in my side
[00:54.26]
[00:55.05]Stain on my blade
[00:57.10]
[00:57.80]Blood on my knife
[00:59.76]
[01:00.40]Been dreaming of her
[01:02.50]
[01:03.15]all of my life
[01:05.37]But she won't come true
[01:06.90]She's just my nightmare I woke up to
[01:09.68]She's twisted, he's a rebel
[01:12.14]She's sick, he's hard to handle
[01:14.83]But worst of all is she just don't care
[01:18.99]
[01:20.10]She's twisted like a rope
[01:22.81]That is wrapped around his throat
[01:25.41]But still worst part of
[01:27.27]all is she really don't give a
[01:31.14]
[01:34.97](She don't give a shit)
[01:37.00]
[01:38.14]Sometimes I wish that you would just die
[01:42.58]
[01:43.50]Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
[01:47.18]
[01:49.34]I didn't know you'd be insane
[01:53.17]
[01:54.33]Dreams can be so deceiving
[01:58.01]
[02:00.01](How did it come to this?
[02:01.56]
[02:02.65]Why do I fantasize to kill you
[02:06.73]when you're sleeping?)
[02:08.75]
[02:11.01]I didn't know you feel the same
[02:14.98]
[02:15.73]When I say you're no good
[02:18.09]all you are to me
[02:20.25]
[02:21.31]is a pain in my neck,
[02:23.13]
[02:23.74]Thorn in my side
[02:25.90]
[02:26.70]Stain on my blade
[02:28.71]
[02:29.28]Blood on my knife
[02:31.91]Been dreaming of her
[02:33.88]
[02:34.60]all of my life
[02:36.87]But she won't come true
[02:38.67]She's just my nightmare I woke up to
[02:41.24]She's twisted, he's a rebel
[02:43.80]She's sick, he's hard to handle
[02:46.61]But worst of all is he just don't care
[02:51.04]
[02:51.70]She's twisted like a rope
[02:54.40]That is wrapped around his throat
[02:57.05]But still worst part of
[02:59.66]all is she really don't give a
[03:03.02]
[03:03.76]Love ain't no fairytale
[03:04.99]Love is a buried nail
[03:06.19]Inside of this heart of stone
[03:07.44]So you wanna get married? Well
[03:08.92]Romeo, Romeo, smokin' blow with Antonio
[03:11.31]In the back alley takin' shots
[03:13.12]of whiskey and only gold
[03:14.42]Juliet's at the nudie bar
[03:15.65]Doin' God only knows
[03:16.78]Neither one of 'em came to see the dog
[03:18.62]and the pony show
[03:19.55]But a bitch is a bitch
[03:20.67]And a horse is a horse
[03:22.05]ain't it? sorry, I can't afford
[03:23.18]to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
[03:24.96]Sorry, Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
[03:27.35]If a dollar makes you holler
[03:28.36]well then I'm gettin' the short change of it, uh
[03:30.97]Feel like I've been asleepin' alone
[03:32.55]And lovin' this angel
[03:33.57]Entangled between a dream and a coma
[03:35.51]Walkin' the edge of this cliff
[03:36.78]Like a sheep to it's owner
[03:38.14]Then woke up to
[03:38.90]this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
[03:40.78]Now if you say that you hate somebody
[03:42.17]and you livin' with them
[03:43.15]Then they pack up and leave
[03:44.61]and you bitch about how you miss 'em
[03:46.38]You gotta see the pattern
[03:47.21]of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
[03:49.32]Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
[03:51.34]
[03:52.13]'Round and 'round we roll,
[03:53.99]Where it stops, baby nobody knows
[03:56.48]Some people go crazy
[03:57.76]and they lose control
[03:59.22]Some people jump off
[04:00.34]Some people won't let go
[04:01.88]Some people say love
[04:03.28]Some people say why
[04:04.64]Some people don't love
[04:05.85]They just want a free ride
[04:07.28]The rain won't stop
[04:08.54]It'll never dry
[04:09.54]If she's in the house of pain
[04:11.15]Then love is standin' outside
[04:12.77]She's twisted, he's a rebel
[04:15.48]She's sick, he's hard to handle
[04:18.16]But worst of all is he just don't care
[04:22.59]
[04:23.36]She's twisted like a rope
[04:26.05]That is wrapped around his throat
[04:28.73]But still worst part of
[04:31.31]all is she really don't give a
[04:34.39]
[04:38.27](She don't give a shit)
[04:40.80]But maybe I'm the twisted one
[04:43.03]that screwed this up
[04:44.49]
[04:45.30]So I guess this means Goodbye,
[04:48.38]
[04:50.82]for now, *laughter*
