[00:16.580]Let's hit the road
[00:18.250]And away we go
[00:19.770]Take a new direction
[00:21.140]To a different coast
[00:23.470]Maybe we should try and put it on the line
[00:31.010]You gotta trust me now
[00:32.620]Turn up the radio
[00:34.540]Tune out the world and roll with the melody
[00:38.340]Baby listen close and open up your mind
[00:44.250]Imagine it, anywhere
[00:47.690]More than miles
[00:49.470]I'll take you there
[00:51.840]Know one day from the sky, we'll be as one
[00:56.840]Now here we are
[00:59.030]All we gotta do is, listen
[01:02.320]All we gotta do is, listen
[01:05.860]All we gotta do is, listen
[01:09.440]All we gotta do is, listen
[01:32.660]Listen
[01:34.230]All we gotta do is, listen
[01:36.760]All we gotta do is, listen
[01:40.980]All we gotta do is, listen
[01:48.260]Soundtrack in the wind
[01:49.940]Like passing violins
[01:51.760]I can be your rhythm in the silence
[01:55.460]And every time we sing an echo's in the sky
[02:03.090]Let me close your eyes
[02:04.760]Help you fantasize
[02:06.680]Make a kiss our playlist the entire night
[02:10.280]Listen to the words and a letter flies
[02:16.910]Imagine it, anywhere
[02:19.780]More than miles
[02:21.500]I'll take you there
[02:23.780]Know one day from the sky, we'll be as one
[02:28.930]Now here we are
[02:30.720]All we gotta do is, listen
[02:34.150]All we gotta do is, listen
[02:37.590]All we gotta do is, listen
[02:41.190]All we gotta do is, listen
[03:04.250]Listen
[03:05.670]All we gotta do is, listen
[03:09.100]All we gotta do is, listen
[03:12.550]All we gotta do is, listen
[03:19.010]Listen
[03:20.280]All we gotta do is, listen
[03:23.470]All we gotta do is, listen
[03:27.210]All we gotta do is, listen
