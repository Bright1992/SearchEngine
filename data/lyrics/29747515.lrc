[00:08.720]I was bound, was tired
[00:12.560]Hadn't seen a light for so long
[00:16.300]Thought I lost my fight
[00:20.040]Couldn't find my way back home
[00:23.890]And I found daylight stepping out of me
[00:31.620]I was bound, and tired
[00:35.370]Waiting for daylight
[00:40.850]Bang my head against the wall
[00:43.070]Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
[00:46.370]I will rise above it all
[00:48.740]Found what I was searching for
[00:50.610]Though I feel light headed
[00:51.530]I should have failed, and nailed the floor
[00:53.670]Instead I rose above it all
[01:02.220]Bang my head against the wall
[01:09.000]Instead I rose above it all
[01:17.850](Bang my head against the wall)
[01:26.610]When you think you're giving up
[01:32.020]Just know, you might think you're dying but you won't
[01:41.180]And you the feel the love, something out of you
[01:49.220]But when you think of giving up, don't
[01:58.080]Bang your head against the wall
[01:59.740]You may feel light headed
[02:01.570]But you won't crawl, no, you won't fall
[02:03.140]You will rise above it all
[02:05.770]You'll find what you're searching for
[02:07.540]And you may feel light headed
[02:09.210]You think you're gonna hit the floor
[02:10.490]Instead you rise above it all
[02:19.610]Bang your head against the wall
[02:26.700]Instead you rise above it all
[02:35.270]Bang your head against the wall
[02:43.410]I have broken wings
[02:47.350]I keep trying, keep trying
[02:51.200]No one get out
[02:55.040]Oh I'm flying, oh I'm flying
[03:02.070]Bang my head against the wall
[03:04.050]Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
[03:06.930]I will rise above it all
[03:09.720]Found what I was searching for
[03:11.740]Though I feel light headed
[03:13.000]I should have failed, and nailed the floor
[03:14.580]Instead I rose above it all
[03:23.340]Bang my head against the wall
[03:30.930]Bang my head against the wall
[03:38.760]Bang my head against the wall
[03:45.530]Instead I rise above it all
