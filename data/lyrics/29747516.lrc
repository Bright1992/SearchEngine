[00:01.890]Black cars, black days
[00:05.400]Rain drops on my window pane
[00:09.150]Street lights, street life
[00:12.850]Hot blood burning in my veins
[00:16.450]History won't drag me down
[00:19.480]I said no no no, I said no no no
[00:23.680]It's buried 6 feet under ground
[00:26.920]Let it go go go, let it go
[00:33.130]Hey, hey, what you say?
[00:35.020]I got no use for yesterday
[00:36.590]I'm gonna live,
[00:37.580]I'm gonna love right now
[00:40.500]if tomorrow never comes
[00:42.200]I'm gonna stay forever young
[00:44.210]These lungs of mine were
[00:45.410]made to scream and shout
[00:47.560]I said hey, hey, what you say?
[00:49.800]It sits on trouble all the way
[00:51.660]I'm gonna live,
[00:52.600]I'm gonna love right now
[00:55.010]You're singing oh oh oh oh
[00:58.650]I said hey, hey, what you say?
[01:01.230]I got no use for yesterday
[01:04.110]I got no, I got no, I got no
[01:08.800]I got no use for yesterday
[01:11.650]I got no, I got no, I got no
[01:16.360]I got no use for yesterday
[01:41.140]Do not, I gotta blue light
[01:43.670]I gotta get right and get it moving
[01:48.430]White lights let me snow blind
[01:51.330]But I know this time
[01:53.090]I'll see right through it
[01:55.800]History won't drag me down
[01:58.700]I said no no no, I said no no no
[02:03.100]It's buried 6 feet under ground
[02:06.090]Let it go go go, let it go
[02:10.690]Hey, hey, what you say?
[02:12.310]I got no use for yesterday
[02:14.220]I'm gonna live,
[02:14.790]I'm gonna love right now
[02:17.950]if tomorrow never comes
[02:19.740]I'm gonna stay forever young
[02:21.620]These lungs of mine were
[02:22.770]made to scream and shout
[02:25.100]I said hey, hey,
[02:26.610]what you say?
[02:27.340]It sits on trouble all the way
[02:29.160]I'm gonna live,
[02:29.990]I'm gonna love right now
[02:32.420]You're singing oh oh oh oh
[02:36.190]I said hey, hey, what you say?
