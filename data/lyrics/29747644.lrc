[00:00]I know that we are upside down
[00:04]So hold your tongue and hear me out
[00:06]I know that we were made to break
[00:10]So what? I don't mind
[00:15]You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds
[00:18]Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
[00:22]I know that we were made to break
[00:25]So what? I don't mind
[00:30]Are you gonna stay the night
[00:34]Are you gonna stay the night
[00:37]Oh oh oh, are you gonna stay the night
[00:44]Are you gonna stay the night
[00:48]Doesn't mean we're bound for life
[00:52]So oh oh, are you gonna stay the night
[01:11]Are you gonna stay the night...
[01:29]Are you gonna stay...
[02:08]I am fire gasoline, come pour yourself all over me

[02:22]You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds
[02:25]Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
[02:29]I know that we were made to break
[02:32]So what? I don't mind
[02:37]Are you gonna stay the night
[02:41]Are you gonna stay the night
[02:44]Oh oh oh, are you gonna stay the night
[02:53]Are you gonna stay the night
[02:56]Doesn't mean we're bound for life
[03:00]So oh oh, are you gonna stay the night...
[03:18]Are you gonna stay the night
