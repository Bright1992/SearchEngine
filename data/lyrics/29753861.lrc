[00:17.21]closing my eyes
[00:18.83]I'm getting high
[00:20.82]again and again
[00:22.69]step out the line
[00:25.19]float in the air
[00:27.14]I'm getting tired
[00:29.09]to follow the world
[00:31.32]I've been tried
[00:33.16]like the stupid sun ,I shine
[00:37.30]like a foolish man ,I write
[00:41.45]like a human being ,I lie
[00:45.50]like a placid lake ,I'm dried
[00:49.73]
[01:07.04]I've been in love
[01:08.91]I used to laugh
[01:11.04]with the laughter
[01:13.15]now they're far
[01:15.21]I met a girl
[01:18.83]I opend the jar
[01:20.13]I want to restart but it's so hard
[01:23.23]like a child to ask you why
[01:27.33]like a friend to say I'm fine
[01:31.51]like a cat I keep being quiet
[01:35.69]like a dream of urs I die.

[01:57.43]closing my eyes
[01:59.15]I'm getting high
[02:01.09]again and again
[02:02.86]step out the line

[02:21.54]like a human being ,I lie
[02:25.69]like a placid lake ,I'm dried
[02:31.53]
[02:32.41]Look back on all the way
[02:36.54]everything was a waste
[02:40.80]everyone was mistake
[02:47.96]
[02:49.01]what if we skip the tale
[02:53.17]what if we get there straight
[02:57.88]that'll really make my day
[03:04.39]
[03:20.77]I've been in love
[03:22.61]I used to laugh
[03:24.56]with the laughter

[03:36.82]like a child to ask you why
[03:40.88]like a friend to say I'm fine
[03:44.99]like a cat I keep being quiet
[03:49.10]like a dream of urs I die.
[03:53.30]like the stupid sun ,I shine
[03:57.54]like a foolish man ,I write
[04:01.70]like a human being ,I lie
[04:05.84]like a placid lake ,I'm dried
