[00:11.340]Santa tell me if you're really there
[00:15.210]Don't make me fall in love again
[00:18.100]If he won't be here next year
[00:21.140]Santa tell me if he really cares
[00:25.330]Cause I can't give it all away
[00:28.390]if he won't be here next year
[00:31.610]Feeling Christmas all around
[00:34.130]And I'm tryna' to play it cool
[00:36.530]But it's hard to focus
[00:38.170]when I see him walking 'cross the room
[00:41.400]Let it snow, is blasting now
[00:44.090]But I won't get it in the mood
[00:46.580]I'm avoiding every mistletoe
[00:49.180]until I know it's true love
[00:52.170]That he thinks of
[00:56.390]So next Christmas I'm not all alone （boy）
[01:01.110]Santa tell me if you're really there
[01:05.290]Don't make me fall in love again
[01:07.370]If he won't be here next year
[01:11.530]Santa tell me if he really cares
[01:15.230]Cause I can't give it all away
[01:18.610]if he won't be here next year
[01:21.620]I've been down this road before
[01:24.060]Fell in love on Christmas night
[01:27.050]But on new year's day I woke up
[01:29.660]and he wasn't by my side
[01:31.740]Now I need someone to hold
[01:34.130]Be my fire in the cold
[01:36.650]But it's hard to tell if this is
[01:38.660]just a fling or if it's true love
[01:42.420]That he thinks of
[01:45.880]So next Christmas I'm not all alone （boy）
[01:51.200]Santa tell me if you're really there
[01:55.330]Don't make me fall in love again
[01:58.410]If he won't be here next year
[02:01.410]Santa tell me if he really cares
[02:05.450]Cause I can't give it all away
[02:08.700]if he won't be here next year
[02:12.570]Oh I wanna have him beside me like ooh
[02:17.790]On the 25th by the fireplace ooh
[02:22.500]But I don't want a new broken heart
[02:25.640]This year I've got to be smart
[02:29.940]Oh baby
[02:32.460]Santa tell me
