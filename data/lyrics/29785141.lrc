[00:04.94]
[00:22.75]One day, if someone wakes me up
[00:26.39]
[00:27.29]Please don't tell me the truth
[00:29.69]that we had the same story before
[00:32.89]Someday, if I'm still in this world,
[00:37.23]please crush me in your arms
[00:39.98]Cause I fear I'm going to die
[00:42.65]
[00:43.21]I thought I am strong
[00:45.90]it's hard to say what would be wrong
[00:47.79]
[00:49.58]Too far from what we've believed
[00:52.88]
[00:53.55]I thought I am strong
[00:56.25]when you held me for so long
[00:59.82]And now my voice is gone
[01:03.25]One day, you came into my dream
[01:07.58]Sat next to me and said you wanted to be free
[01:13.10]I said one day, you will be free
[01:21.26]
[01:23.51]Just know that you are strong
[01:28.69]Don't be gone for too long, if you do
[01:35.36]Just follow my voice in this song
[01:38.56]You'll come around
[01:41.36]
[02:06.89]One day, if someone wakes me up
[02:11.33]Please don't tell me the truth
[02:13.87]that we had the same story before
[02:16.24]
[02:16.92]One day, you broke my heart,
[02:21.25]
[02:21.81]You took my dream and stole my soul,
[02:24.33]you left me alone with nothing to say
[02:27.36]I thought I am strong
[02:30.08]it's hard to say what would be wrong
[02:33.46]
[02:34.11]Too far from what we've believed
[02:37.96]I thought I am strong
[02:40.59]when you held me for so long
[02:44.15]And now my voice is gone
[02:47.48]One day, you came into my dream
[02:52.13]Sat next to me and said you wanted to be free
[02:57.31]I said one day, you will be free
[03:06.12]
[03:07.83]Just know that you are strong
[03:13.01]Don't be gone for too long, if you do
[03:19.66]Just follow my voice in this song
[03:22.68]You'll come around
[03:26.95]
[03:49.78]One day, you came into my dream
[03:54.73]Sat next to me and said you wanted to be free
[03:59.90]I said one day, you will be free
[04:08.00]
[04:10.40]Just know that you are strong
[04:15.58]Don't be gone for too long, if you do
[04:22.25]Just follow my voice in this song
[04:25.33]You'll come around
[04:29.36]
[04:30.50]You'll come around
