[00:13.720]
[00:15.050]Am I just a fool?
[00:22.540]Blind and stupid for loving you
[00:30.210]Am I just a silly girl?
[00:37.070]So young and naive to think you were
[00:43.600]The one who came to take claim of this heart
[00:50.270]Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark
[00:57.400]
[00:57.740]And now the people are talking
[01:02.430]The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
[01:07.380]Like a grand piano
[01:14.060]The people are talking
[01:16.960]The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
[01:21.930]Like a grand piano
[01:27.590]So play on, play on, play on
[01:56.920]
[01:58.020]Am I being a fool?
[02:05.010]Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths
[02:12.380]What do I see in you?
[02:19.350]Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do
[02:24.670]Cause I keep thinking you were
[02:26.520]The one who came to take claim of this heart
[02:32.750]Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark
[02:41.270]
[02:42.050]The people are talking
[02:44.680]The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
[02:49.690]Like a grand piano
[02:56.490]The people are talking
[02:59.180]The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
[03:04.370]Like a grand piano
[03:10.060]So play on, play on, play on
[03:39.020]
