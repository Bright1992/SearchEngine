[00:53.860]向前跑
[00:57.360]迎着冷眼和嘲笑
[01:01.270]生命的广阔不历经磨难怎能感到
[01:09.350]命运它无法让我们跪地求饶
[01:17.780]就算鲜血洒满了怀抱
[01:25.840]继续跑
[01:29.380]带着赤子的骄傲
[01:33.220]生命的闪耀不坚持到底怎能看到
[01:41.760]与其苟延残喘不如纵情燃烧吧
[01:51.200]为了心中的美好
[01:59.510]不妥协直到变老
[02:03.530]
[02:18.700]Sunday's coming i wanna drive my car
[02:22.020]to your apartment with a present like a star
[02:26.040]forecaster said the weather may be rainy hard
[02:29.970]but i know the sun will shine for us
[02:34.500]oh lazy seagull fly me from the dark
[02:37.990]i dress my jeans and feed my monkey banana
[02:42.070]then i think my age how old,skyline how far
[02:46.550]or we need each other in california
[02:50.630]you show me your body before night comes down
[02:54.710]i touch your face and promise to stay ever young
[02:58.600]on this ivory beach we kissed so long
[03:02.640]it seems that the passion's never gone
[03:06.640]you sing me your melody and i feel so please
[03:10.650]i want you to want me to keep your dream
[03:14.570]together we'll run wild by a summer symphony
[03:18.630]this is what we enjoyed not a fantasy
[03:23.220]
