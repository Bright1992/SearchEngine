[00:00.030]I miss that happy friend that I had
[00:03.340]You've been acting so sad
[00:05.310]Won't you comeback? yeah yeah
[00:09.640]You never take the time when you cuss some more
[00:12.750]Always with your new boy
[00:14.920]But he ain't all that
[00:17.800]But you don't know yet always
[00:20.370]His kiss is soft and sweet
[00:21.950]He sweeps you off your feet
[00:24.380]He's no good for you
[00:26.510]He's no good for you
[00:28.940]And sure he's worth a lot of gold
[00:31.780]But you're better than you know

[01:07.420]He drives those fancy cars that you like
[01:10.340]But he doesn't call you at night
[01:12.480]And tells you he loves you
[01:14.810]He's thinking of you
[01:17.120]No you can't take him home for the holidays
[01:20.250]Better keep him away

[02:15.210]Won't you take it from a friend
[02:17.310]That boy is not a gentleman
[02:19.790]And you'll find out soon enough
[02:22.230]What you're feeling it ain't love
[02:24.440]Cause he called me yesterday
[02:27.110]And he asked me on a date
[02:29.480]Tried to play you like a fool
[02:32.000]And that's why I'm calling you
[02:34.500]And his kiss is soft and sweet
[02:36.620]He sweeps you off your feet
[02:38.780]He's no good for you
[02:41.090]He's no good for you
[02:43.440]And sure he's worth a lot of gold
[02:46.170]But you're better than you know
[02:48.420]He's no good for you
[02:53.360]His kiss is soft and sweet
[02:55.500]He sweeps you off your feet
