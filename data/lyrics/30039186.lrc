[00:00.000]This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
[00:04.010]Been so long I forgot how to turn it
[00:07.110]Up up up up, all night long
[00:10.270]Up up all night long
[00:15.450]You, where the hell did you come from
[00:19.840]You're a different, different kind of fun
[00:23.290]And i'm so used to feeling numb
[00:28.140]Now, I got pins and needles on my tongue
[00:32.880]Anticipating what's to come
[00:35.830]Like a finger on a loaded gun
[00:41.120]I can feel it rising
[00:44.320]Temperature inside me
[00:47.370]Haven't felt it for a long time
[00:53.260]This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
[00:56.800]Been so long I forgot how to turn it
[01:00.040]Up up up up, all night long
[01:03.190]Up up all night long
[01:05.970]This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
[01:09.610]Turned it on but I know you can take it
[01:12.840]Up up up up, all night long
[01:15.990]Up up all night long
[01:19.790]I, I wasn't even gonna go out
[01:23.930]But I never would have had a doubt
[01:27.260]If i'd have known where i'd be now
[01:32.300]Your hands on my hips
[01:35.300]And my kiss on your lips
[01:38.500]Oh I could do this for a long time
[01:44.590]This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
[01:48.090]Been so long I forgot how to turn it
[01:51.380]Up up up up, all night long
[01:54.480]Up up all night long
[01:57.270]This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
[02:00.930]Turned it on but I know you can take it
[02:04.170]Up up up up, all night long
[02:07.320]Up up all night long
[02:09.570]Until tonight I only dreamed about you
[02:12.720]I can't believe I ever breathed without you
[02:15.910]Baby you make me feel alive and brand new
[02:18.850]Bring it one more time (one more time)
[02:24.680]This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
[02:28.230]Been so long I forgot how to turn it
[02:31.460]Up up up up, all night long
[02:34.870]Up up all night long (Yeah)
[02:37.750]This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
[02:41.410]Turned it on but I know you can take it
[02:44.590]Up up up up, all night long
[02:47.690]Up up all night long
[02:50.670]This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
[02:54.220]Been so long I forgot how to turn it
[02:57.460]Up up up up, all night long
[03:00.520]Up up all night long
[03:03.450]This is my heartbeat song and i'm gonna play it
[03:07.050]Turned it on but I know you can take it
[03:10.230]Up up up up, all night long
[03:13.330]Up up all night long
