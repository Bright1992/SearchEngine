[00:06.050]I’ve got to get out of here
[00:08.490]This town’s no longer fun
[00:10.900]And I’m falling closer, falling closer
[00:13.960]Closer to the sun
[00:16.120]I’ve got to get out of here
[00:18.420]Come kiss another face
[00:20.870]Cause it hurts too bad, it hurts too bad
[00:23.780]And I don’t like the taste
[00:26.080]You say it’s over, leaving me so far from sober
[00:31.070]Now sun is colder, I lean on a stranger’s shoulder
[00:36.180]I walk the streets
[00:37.510]and there are beats and cities smoulder
[00:41.340]Without a trace I’m under
[00:44.900]And God knows I try
[00:49.730]Looking for lovers at night
[00:54.800]But each time I do
[00:59.630]It only reminds me of you
[01:04.790]It only reminds me of you
[01:22.100]I’ve got to get out of here
[01:24.430]Cause you never want me back
[01:26.800]You are moving on, moving on
[01:29.740]And I’m stuck on the track
[01:32.030]I’ve gotta get out of here
[01:34.440]Before I self-destruct
[01:36.970]And I don’t want, I don’t want
[01:39.730]My heart to ever stop
[01:41.970]I walk the streets
[01:43.510]and there are beats and cities smoulder
[01:47.170]Without a trade I’m under
[01:50.510]And God knows I try
[01:55.530]Looking for lovers at night
[02:00.630]But each time I do
[02:05.540]It only reminds me of you
[02:10.640]It only reminds me of you
[02:38.450]And God knows I try
[02:43.590]Looking for lovers at  night
[02:48.580]But each time I do
[02:53.470]It only reminds me of you
[02:58.600]It only reminds me of you
[03:03.580]It only reminds me of you
[03:08.350]
