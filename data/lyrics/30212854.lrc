[00:00.800]I need someone, that I'll look to,
[00:08.160]In the lonely hour, that we all go through
[00:16.360]To give me comfort, and love me through
[00:24.470]In the lonely hour, I need you
[00:34.050]I need you
[00:42.920]I need you
[00:49.330]I don't need diamonds, I don't need jewels
[00:56.770]No amount of riches will cover up these blues
[01:04.200]I don't need suggestions, about a starting new
[01:11.920]In the lonely hour, I need you
[01:20.340]There's nothing I can do, I'm helpless without you
[01:44.370]Its a losing point of view
[01:47.840]when there's a wistful silence, in an empty room
[01:52.610]These other voice's, they don't cut through
[01:59.860]In the lonely hour, I need you
[02:07.800]I need you
[02:15.330]And I need you
[02:23.130]I need someone, that I'll look to,
[02:31.020]In the lonely hour, I need you
[02:40.420]I need you
[02:43.060]
