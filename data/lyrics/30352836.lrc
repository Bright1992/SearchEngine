[00:00.81]I'm running away from this pain
[00:04.57]I'm trying to find a new way
[00:07.87]Where the sun shining down on my face
[00:12.13]I'm running away
[00:15.48]You're in a toxic relationship
[00:23.66]Time to be free
[01:00.24]You're no-no-no-no-no-no-not for me
[01:09.48]Please baby please baby baby
[01:46.24]I'm running away from this pain
