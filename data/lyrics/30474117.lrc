[00:17.400]But being and feeling alone was too much to face,
[00:23.800]Though everyone said that she was so strong,
[00:28.180]What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on,
[00:33.380]But she knew that she would be okay,
[00:37.770]So she didn't let it get in her way,
[00:43.590]Sometimes it all gets a little too much,
[00:48.270]But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
[00:53.950]And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
[00:59.990]And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much,
[01:07.100]She would always tell herself that she could do this
[01:12.580]She would use no help it would be just fine
[01:18.650]But when it got hard she would lose her focus
[01:24.200]So take my hand and we'll be alright
[01:28.580]And she knew that she would be okay,
[01:32.820]So she didn't let it get in her way,

[02:19.490]But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up,
[02:25.050]And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same,
[02:31.000]And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much yeah!
