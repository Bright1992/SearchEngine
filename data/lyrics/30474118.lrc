[00:00.050]The Weight
[00:06.230]
[00:12.410]I want to go back, forget that it's over
[00:17.620]
[00:18.410]Paint it in black, when you left me alone
[00:23.030]
[00:24.270]I never knew, she was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with
[00:30.010]And I can't go back to her anymore, no more
[00:36.650]
[00:37.940]You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
[00:43.810]And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away
[00:49.220]
[00:49.750]And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
[00:54.850]No I can't lift the weight
[00:56.350]
[01:02.170]Put you in the past, try to forget you cause it's over
[01:07.200]
[01:08.030]And every time you ask I'll pretend I'm okay
[01:12.990]
[01:13.760]You're inside my head
[01:16.040]In the middle of the night when I don't feel right
[01:17.550]I dream I can hold you
[01:19.770]And I can't go back to you anymore, yeah, yeah
[01:26.420]
[01:27.790]You tell me you were happier within, you want me to stay
[01:33.360]And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away
[01:39.520]But then you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
[01:44.500]But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight
[01:50.040]
[01:51.090]And I can't lift the weigh, no I can't lift the weight
[01:53.940]Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
[01:57.110]I can't lift the weigh, no I can't lift the weight
[01:59.770]Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
[02:02.980]I can't lift the weigh, no I can't lift the weight
[02:05.590]Yeah, you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
[02:08.780]I can't lift the weigh, no I can't lift the weight
[02:14.230]
[02:14.910]Tell me you were happier within but you want me to stay
[02:19.670]
[02:20.240]And you tell me that you needed time but you, you push me away
[02:26.420]But then you try to take it back, my heavy heart just breaks
[02:31.370]But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight
[02:36.940]
[02:38.160]Tell me you were happier within, you want me to stay
[02:43.180]
[02:43.810]You told me that you needed time but you, you push me away
[02:49.780]And then you try to take me back
[02:52.490]Say someday you will change, but I don't wanna wait
