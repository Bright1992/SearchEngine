[00:01.920]I feel like the sky is falling down
[00:04.240]Ain't nobody here to play around
[00:07.090]Push it to the edge, I won't back down
[00:09.860]Cause it's time to go hard or go home
[00:12.570]One way up, no way out
[00:15.410]I give it all, all for the family
[00:18.440]We stay up, no bail outs
[00:21.030]Give it all, all for the family
[00:27.760]Five, four, three, two, I got one shot
[00:29.520]You lose the love and respect, that's where the trust stop
[00:32.790]New work, top drop
[00:35.280]I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop
[00:38.050]And you can smell just how I'm smokin' when I burn out
[00:40.970]And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not
[00:44.210]It's love and loyalty until my heart lock
[00:46.810]Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out
[00:50.620]I said it once, I'll do it again
[00:52.140]I'm playin' the game, I do it to win
[00:53.510]With you and your friend, that's thick and thin
[00:54.900]That's me and my team, you know we gon' win
[00:56.330]You know we gon' ball, you know we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
[00:58.540]You know we gon' stick to the course, we ain't thinkin' 'bout y'all
[01:01.430]I feel like the sky is falling down
[01:04.240]Ain't nobody here to play around
[01:06.980]Push it to the edge, I won't back down
[01:09.900]Cause it's time to go hard or go home
[01:12.540]One way up, no way out
[01:15.180]I give it all, all for the family
[01:18.260]We stay up, no bail outs
[01:21.050]Give it all, all for the family
[01:38.590]M-O-N-E-Y, what I go hard for
[01:40.560]Swingin' on the green like I'm tryna get a par four
[01:43.870]You ain't sittin' at my table, hope you starve
[01:46.430]Ho, don't be pushin' my buttons 'less you startin' up my car
[01:49.340]Pressure make a diamond, that pressure make me a star
[01:51.820]Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar
[01:54.970]People always askin' me how I got this far
[01:57.490]My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are
[02:00.260]Now they call me Mrs. Money like I'm married to the mula
[02:03.150]Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers
[02:06.500]Glory, hallelujah, I'ma take that ass to church
[02:09.010]I'ma finish like I started, Iggy still got that work
[02:12.820]I feel like the sky is falling down
[02:15.720]Ain't nobody here to play around
[02:18.480]Push it to the edge, I won't back down
[02:21.460]Cause it's time to go hard or go home
[02:23.960]One way up, no way out
[02:26.780]I give it all, all for the family
[02:29.670]We stay up, no bail outs
[02:32.470]Give it all, all for the family
[03:12.830]I feel like the sky is falling down
[03:15.650]Ain't nobody here to play around
[03:18.430]Push it to the edge, I won't back down
[03:21.380]Cause it's time to go hard or go home
[03:24.020]One way up, no way out
[03:26.790]I give it all, all for the family
[03:29.690]We stay up, no bail outs
[03:32.480]Give it all, all for the family
