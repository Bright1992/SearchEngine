[00:09.19]And all I remember is your back
[00:16.46]
[00:18.12]Walking towards the airport, leaving us all in your past
[00:24.39]
[00:26.45]I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
[00:32.27]
[00:36.03]Begged you to want me, but you didn’t want to
[00:42.44]
[00:44.57]But piece by piece, he collected me
[00:49.49]Up off the ground, where you abandoned things and
[00:54.51]Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
[01:01.26]Six years old and you know, he never walks away
[01:06.00]He never asks for money, he takes care of me
[01:10.42]He loves me
[01:12.38]Piece by piece, he restored my faith
[01:16.72]That a man can be kind and a father could stay
[01:23.00]
[01:26.00]And all of your words fall flat
[01:34.75]I made something of myself and now you want to come back
[01:40.75]
[01:43.36]But your love, it isn’t free, it has to be earned
[01:50.67]
[01:52.70]Back then I didn’t have anything you needed so I was worthless
[02:00.31]
[02:01.74]But piece by piece, he collected me
[02:06.22]Up off the ground, where you abandoned things and
[02:11.60]Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
[02:17.76]Six years old and you know, he never walks away
[02:22.94]He never asks for money, he takes care of me
[02:27.31]Cause he loves me
[02:29.42]Piece by piece, he restored my faith
[02:33.56]That a man can be kind and a father could stay
[02:39.84]Piece by piece...
[02:44.09]Piece by piece...
[02:48.77]Piece by piece...
[02:53.31]Piece by piece...
[02:57.94]Piece by piece...
[03:04.70]Piece by piece...
[03:14.57]Piece by piece I fell far from the tree
[03:18.85]I will never leave her like you left me
[03:23.47]And she will never have to wonder her worth
[03:27.84]Because unlike you I’m going to put her first
[03:32.58]And you know, he’ll never walk away,
[03:35.22]He’ll never break her heart
[03:37.91]He’ll take care of things, he’ll love her
[03:42.07]Piece by piece, he restored my faith
[03:46.29]That a man can be kind and a father should be great
[03:52.68]Piece by piece...
[03:56.34]Piece by piece...
[04:01.25]Piece by piece...
[04:05.69]
