[00:09.000]I wonder how your body tastes
[00:17.910]Inside of someone else's place
[00:25.050]Pull away your eyes
[00:27.680]There's nothing left to heal
[00:33.650]I'm alone, but I know everything you feel
[00:42.410]And you waited on the rain
[00:48.960]Through tears my heart is caged
[00:53.130]And we fall through fate
[00:57.350]And we rise and rise again
[01:01.960]And I run, run, run, run, run
[01:06.140]And I run, run, run, run, run
[01:10.640]I run, run, run, run, run
[01:14.570]I just run run run
[01:17.390]Tell me how you closed the door
[01:26.060]Knowin' nobody could love you more
[01:33.540]Tellin' all your friends that this love was just made for bleedin'
[01:42.210]Hung up underwater but still we keep on, tryin' to breath in
[01:50.710]And you waited on the rain
[01:57.620]Through tears my heart is caged
[02:01.600]And we fall through fate
[02:05.860]And we rise and rise again
[02:10.350]And I run, run, run, run, run
[02:14.640]And I run, run, run, run, run
[02:19.120]I run, run, run, run, run
[02:23.130]I just run run run
[02:26.020]Our lust for fighting
[02:34.610]Tied up in silence
[03:17.550]And you waited on the rain
[03:23.760]Through tears my heart is caged
[03:27.980]And we fall through fate
[03:32.160]And we rise and rise again
[03:36.660]And I run, run, run, run, run
[03:40.960]And I run, run, run, run, run
[03:45.150]I run, run, run, run, run, run
[03:49.670]I run, run, run, run, run, run
[03:58.030]I run, run, run, run, run
[04:02.700]I run, run, run, run, run
[04:06.720]I just run run run
[04:09.220]Our love is for fightin'
[04:18.000]Tied up in silence
