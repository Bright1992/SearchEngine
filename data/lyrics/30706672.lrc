[00:22.342]So this is my apology
[00:26.283]For saying all those shitty things
[00:30.244]I wish I didn't really mean
[00:34.672]I'm sorry I'm not sorry
[00:37.189]You had your red flags up and raised
[00:41.157]More traffic than east L.A
[00:45.369]But I drove in anyway
[00:48.573]My common sense on holiday
[00:51.386]People fall out of phase
[00:53.289]We were a crashed cause
[00:55.983]We were just, be a place
[00:57.494]stuck on your passport
[00:59.168]You travel to some time
[01:02.725]But I hope you'll find
[01:05.893]Someone to cry for
[01:09.493]Someone to try for
[01:12.209]Someone to turn your crooked
[01:15.179]roads into her streets
[01:20.572]Someone to fight for
[01:24.479]Someone to die for
[01:28.854]Someone whose arms will
[01:29.278]hold you tight enough to be
[01:34.147]The reason you breathe
[01:41.189]Be the reason you breathe
[01:52.478]You stay in love like vacation homes
[01:56.784]You like summer on the sunny coast
[02:00.489]But when the cold need a winter coat
[02:03.823]You say you will until you don't
[02:07.283]You wore a comb fist around your neck
[02:11.796]A different north in the ever end
[02:15.732]What did you get where you going yet
[02:18.899]We're sure the worst, we're sure the best
[02:21.820]I don't know how I fell into your rear view
[02:25.289]Paralyzed, alibi, I couldn't hear you
[02:28.579]So I hope you were right
[02:32.489]And I see you tonight
[02:35.245]Someone to cry for
[02:39.532]Someone to try for
[02:42.824]Someone to turn your crooked roads
[02:46.323]into her streets
[02:50.346]Someone to fight for
[02:54.864]Someone to die for
[02:57.659]Someone whose arms will hold
[02:59.169]you tight enough to be
[03:04.653]The reason you breathe
[03:12.328]Be the reason you breathe
[03:22.674]So this is my apology
[03:26.549]For saying all those shitty things
[03:30.758]I wish I didn't really mean
[03:34.276]sorry I'm not sorry
