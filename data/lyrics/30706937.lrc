[00:27.38]You where the hell did you come from
[00:32.47]You're a different different kind of fun
[00:36.06]And I’m so used to feeling numb
[02:30.90][00:41.15]Now I got pins and needles on my tongue
[02:36.14][00:46.38]Anticipating what's to come
[02:39.28][00:49.49]Like a finger on a loaded gun
[03:39.68][02:44.76][01:49.99][00:54.92]I can feel it rising
[03:43.02][02:48.06][01:53.27][00:58.13]Temperature inside me
[03:46.56][02:51.76][01:56.76][01:02.03]Haven't felt it for a long time
[03:53.19][02:58.64][02:03.56][01:08.71]Your hands on my hips
[03:56.73][03:01.99][02:07.45][01:12.29]And my kiss on your lips
[04:00.72][03:05.33][02:10.50][01:15.82]Oh I could do this for a long time
[04:05.96][03:10.86][01:21.31]
[02:17.45]I wasn't even goanna go out
[02:22.23]But I never would have had a doubt
[02:25.73]If I’d have known where I’d be now
