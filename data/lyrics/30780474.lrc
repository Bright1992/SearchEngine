[00:18.23]Or are you gonna hurt me later?
[00:21.67]Are you gonna go to town?
[00:25.00]Maybe you should play it safer.
[00:28.95]You got me all dressed up tonight,
[00:32.41]Springsteen on the radio.
[00:35.76]You've got me all freaked out tonight,
[00:39.29]Something' you're tellin' me but I don't know.
[00:42.34]You don't wanna break me down,
[00:45.61]You don't wanna say goodbye and,
[00:48.88]You don't wanna turn around,
[00:52.54]You don't wanna make me cry.
[00:55.25]But you caught me once,
[00:57.91]Baby, on the flipside I could,
[01:00.66]Catch you again.
[01:02.81]You caught me once,
[01:04.81]Baby, on the flipside you could,
[01:07.54]Catch me again.
[02:32.20]Are you gonna tell me now,
[02:35.17]Are you gonna tell me later?
[02:38.60]'Cause if you think that I don't know,
[02:42.14]I'm gonna have to say you're crazy.
[02:46.01]I'm getting' all dressed up tonight,
[02:49.75]Dressed up just to hear you, boy.
[02:52.88]I already know what you got in store,
[02:56.51]Why I go, baby, I don't know.

[03:02.73]You don't wanna say goodbye and,
[03:05.98]You don't wanna turn around,
[03:09.61]You don't wanna make me cry.
[03:13.01]But you caught me once,
[03:14.79]Baby, on the flipside I could,
[03:17.88]Catch you again.
[03:19.94]You caught me once,
