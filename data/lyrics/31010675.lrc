[00:10.560]Is your head spinning?
[00:12.170]Is your heart racing?
[00:13.960]Is the fire in your veins?
[00:17.760]Are your bones burning?
[00:19.310]Is your skin yearning?
[00:21.380]'Cause you're driving me insane
[00:25.330]I kinda feel like I feel like a summer light
[00:29.190]You got me waiting up a thousand miles
[00:33.000]Can we stay right here in the sand
[00:36.670]Must feel like we're flying out in space
[00:40.200]Don't look down
[00:43.850]Off this high will never hit the ground
[00:47.410]Don't look down
[00:51.220]See that the sky we're gonna reach it now
[00:55.290]Do you feel the lightning inside of you
[00:59.170]Will you follow through if I fall for you
[01:02.410]Don't look down
[01:06.370]Off this high will never hit the ground
[01:12.540][Beat break]
[01:44.260]Are you hands shaking?
[01:45.990]Are your fears breaking?
[01:47.900]Are you climbing all the walls?
[01:51.680]All the time changing, is the noise fading?
[01:55.720]'Cause I wanna get it all
[01:59.580]I kinda feel like I feel like a summer light
[02:02.830]You got me waiting up a thousand miles
[02:06.630]Can we stay right here in the sand
[02:11.960]Must feel or are you afraid to fall?
[02:14.000]Don't look down
[02:17.900]Off this high will never hit the ground
[02:21.160]Don't look down
[02:25.060]See that the sky we're gonna reach it now
[02:28.940]Do you feel the lightning inside of you
[02:33.600]Will you follow through if I fall for you
[02:36.050]Don't look down
[02:40.240]Off this high will never hit the ground
[02:44.460][Beat break]
[03:00.660]Don't look down
[03:15.990]Do you feel the lightning inside of you
[03:19.450]Will you follow through if I fall for you
[03:23.090]Don't look down
[03:27.010]Off this high will never hit the ground
