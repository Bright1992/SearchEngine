[00:02.87]Darling, darling, oh, turn the lights back on now
[00:07.51]Watching, watching, as the credits all roll down
[00:12.45]Crying, crying, you know we're playing to a full house, house
[00:21.10]No heroes, villains, one to blame
[00:23.61]While wilted roses fill the stage
[00:25.97]And the thrill, the thrill is gone
[00:30.70]Our debut was a masterpiece
[00:33.35]But in the end for you and me
[00:35.53]Oh, the show, it can't go on
[00:41.66]We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
[00:46.44]So hold for the applause, oh
[00:51.18]And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
[00:56.24]Oh, it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show
[01:00.93]At least we stole the show
[01:03.41]At least we stole the show
[01:05.74]At least we stole the show
[01:08.16]At least we stole the show
[01:49.08]At least we stole the show
[01:53.14]Darling, darling, you know that we are sold out
[01:58.09]This is fading, but the band plays on now
[02:02.74]We're crying, crying, so let the velvet roll down, down
[02:11.83]No heroes, villains, one to blame
[02:14.03]While wilted roses fill the stage
[02:16.30]And the thrill, the thrill is gone
[02:21.17]Our debut was a masterpiece
[02:23.59]Our lines we read so perfectly
[02:25.85]But the show, it can't go on
[02:32.09]We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
[02:36.79]So hold for the applause, oh
[02:41.61]And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
[02:46.54]Oh, it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show
[02:56.12]At least we stole the show
[03:01.15]At least we stole the show
[03:11.27]At least we stole the show
[03:20.33]At least we stole the show
