[00:16.410]Aren't you somethin' to admire
[00:19.280]Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
[00:21.800]And I can't help but notice
[00:24.060]You reflect in this heart of mine
[00:28.530]If you ever feel alone and
[00:31.910]The glare makes me hard to find
[00:34.470]Just know that I'm always
[00:36.510]Parallel on the other side
[00:40.350]Cus with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
[00:43.670]I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
[00:46.640]Just put your hand on the past
[00:48.210]I'm here tryin' to pull you through
[00:50.200]You just gotta be strong
[00:52.260]Cause I don't wanna lose you now
[00:55.350]I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
[00:58.570]The biggest scene is set in my heart
[01:01.560]There's a space, but now you're home
[01:04.880]Show me how to fight for now
[01:08.500]And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
[01:10.350]Comin' back into you once I figured it out
[01:13.820]You were right here all along
[01:18.030]It's like you're my mirror
[01:21.000]My mirror staring back at me
[01:23.940]I couldn't get any bigger
[01:26.840]With anyone else beside me
[01:30.240]And now it's clear as this promise
[01:32.370]That we're making
[01:33.980]Two reflections into one
[01:36.280]Cause it's like you're my mirror
[01:39.550]My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
[01:43.290]Aren't you somethin', an original
[01:46.480]Cause it doesn't seem really as simple
[01:48.840]And i can't help but stare cause
[01:51.170]I see truth somewhere in your eyes
[01:56.200]I can't ever change without you
[01:58.970]You reflect me, I love that about you
[02:02.200]And if I could, I
[02:03.700]Would look at us all the time
[02:07.560]Cus with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
[02:10.670]I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
[02:13.880]Just put your hand on the past
[02:15.360]I'm here tryin' to pull you through
[02:16.930]You just gotta be strong
[02:19.550]Cause I don't wanna lose you now
[02:22.290]I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
[02:26.100]The biggest scene is set in my heart
[02:28.520]There's a space, but now you're home
[02:31.920]Show me how to fight for now
[02:34.840]And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
[02:37.510]Comin' back into you once I figured it out
[02:40.920]You were right here all along
[02:45.160]It's like you're my mirror
[02:47.940]My mirror staring back at me

[03:01.150]Two reflections into one
[03:03.560]Cause it's like you're my mirror
[03:06.900]My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
[03:14.610]Yesterday is history
[03:20.990]Tomorrow's a mystery
[03:27.040]I can see you lookin' back at me
[03:31.930]Baby, keep your eyes on me
[03:34.350]Cause I don't wanna lose you now
[03:37.270]I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
[03:40.520]The biggest scene is set in my heart
