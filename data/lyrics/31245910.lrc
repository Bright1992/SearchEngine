[00:01.48]When your legs don’t work like they used to before
[00:05.77]And I can’t sweep you off of your feet
[00:10.64]Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
[00:16.08]Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
[00:19.29]Darlin I, will be lovin’ you till we’re seventy
[00:28.84]And baby my heart could still feel as hard at twenty three
[00:36.96]And I’m thinking about how people
[00:39.49]fall in love in mysterious ways
[00:43.68]Maybe just the touch of a hand
[00:48.38]Well me I fall in love with you every single day
[00:53.08]And I just wanna tell you I am
[00:57.03]So honey now
[01:01.24]Take me into your lovin arms
[01:06.05]Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
[01:10.81]Place your head on my beating heart
[01:14.50]I’m thinking out loud
[01:16.68]Maybe we found love right where we are
[01:55.56]Maybe we found love right where we are
[02:01.45]When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
[02:05.99]And the crowds don’t remember my name
[02:10.05]When my hands don’t play the strings the same way
[02:15.87]I know you will still love me the same
[02:19.18]Cos honey your soul could never grow old
[02:23.72]It’s ever green
[02:28.58]And baby your smile’s
[02:31.08]Forever in my mind and memory
[02:36.93]I’m thinking about how people
[02:38.85]fall in love in mysterious ways
[02:43.75]And maybe it’s all part of a plan
[02:48.17]I’ll just keep on making the same mistakes
[02:53.25]Hoping that you’ll understand
[02:57.34]That baby now
[03:01.53]Take me into your loving arms
[03:06.36]Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
[03:11.12]Place your head on my beating heart
[03:14.71]Thinking out loud
[03:17.21]Baby we found love right where we are
[03:21.82]Baby we found love right where we are
[03:26.98]We found love right where we are
[04:05.00]Baby we found love right where we are
[04:43.56]Baby we found love right where we are
[04:48.32]Baby we found love right where we are
[04:53.13]We found love right where we are
