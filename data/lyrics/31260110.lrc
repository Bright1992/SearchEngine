[00:07.62]I've been thinking about the time we used to waste
[00:11.36]And now I'm drinking trying to find something that tastes the way that we did
[00:17.58]But your just a ghost and nothing comes close
[00:24.08]We bummed mornings laying in your bed doing nothing with you
[00:29.94]Yeah that was the best
[00:31.59]Out of all the places I've been ever since
[00:35.71]It's the only place I'll never be again
[00:39.78]I found you once I won't find you again
[00:43.52]You were the first you were my best friend
[00:47.40]I didn't think it ever could end
[00:51.49]You were my first love, you were my first love
[00:55.83]I was so young I didn't think twice
[00:59.29]I felt so hard took no one's advice
[01:03.19]I didn't think it ever could end
[01:07.44]You were my first love, you were my first love
[01:11.38]I've been slipping
[01:13.48]I've been trying to pretend there's nothing missing
[01:17.37]And when I'm with somebody else it's you I'm wishing that I was kissing
[01:23.58]But you're just a ghost and nothing comes close
[01:27.99]We bummed mornings laying in your bed doing nothing with you
[01:33.84]Yeah that was the best
[01:35.43]Out of all the places I've been ever since
[01:39.43]It's the only place I'll never be again
[01:43.66]I found you once I won't find you again
[01:47.34]You were the first you were my best friend
[01:51.38]I didn't think it ever could end
[01:55.56]You were my first love, you were my first love
[02:00.00]I was so young I didn't think twice
[02:03.74]I felt so hard took no one's advice
[02:07.45]I didn't think it ever could end
[02:11.45]You were my first love, you were my first love
[02:16.32]You're something I can't forget
[02:18.17]I try so hard to let go, but nothing can pry you from my bones
[02:24.11]Won't go to places we went, deleted you from my phone
[02:28.72]but you still follow me round like you're a ghost
[02:47.63]I found you once won't find you again
[02:51.27]You were the first you were my best friend
[02:55.58]I didn't think it ever could end
[02:59.58]You were my first love, you were my first love
[03:03.81]I was so young I didn't think twice
[03:07.51]I felt so hard took no one's advice
[03:11.50]I didn't think it ever could end
[03:15.38]You were my first love, you were my first love
