[00:32.44]I'm a flame short of fire
[00:37.10]I'm the dark in need of light
[00:41.36]When we touch you inspire
[00:45.59]Feel it changin' me tonight

[00:58.08]We can dance in desire
[01:02.09]Or we can burn in love tonight
[01:08.82]Our hearts are like
[01:10.33]Firestones
[01:12.47]And when they strike
[01:14.27]We feel the love
[01:16.40]Sparks will fly
[01:18.33]They ignite our bones
[01:20.28]And when they strike
[01:21.91]We light up the world

[01:37.19]And when they strike
