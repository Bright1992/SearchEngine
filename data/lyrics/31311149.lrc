[00:03.19]I really wanna stop
[00:05.10]But I just gotta taste for it
[00:07.66]I feel like I could fly with the ball on the moon
[00:11.71]So honey hold my hand you like making me wait for it
[00:15.89]I feel I could die walkinâ€˜ up to the room, oh yeah
[00:21.55]Late night watching television
[00:25.53]But how we get in this position?
[00:29.52]It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
[00:36.20]But I need to tell you something
[00:40.04]I really really really really really really like you
[00:45.59]And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
[00:48.02]I really really really really really really like you
[00:51.71]And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
[00:54.98]Oh, did I say too much?
[00:58.31]I'm so in my head
[01:00.39]When we're out of touch
[01:03.37]I really really really really really really like you
[01:08.40]And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
[02:00.29]It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
[02:04.61]All I wanna do is get into your head
[02:08.65]Yeah we could stay alone, you and me, and this temptation
[02:13.39]Sipping on your lips, hanging on by thread, baby
[02:18.21]Late night watching television
[02:22.11]But how we get in this position?
[02:26.35]It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
[02:33.35]But I need to tell you something
[02:34.68]I really really really really really really like you
[02:40.05]And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
[02:43.54]I really really really really really really like you
[02:48.11]And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
[02:51.54]Oh, did I say too much?
[02:55.07]I'm so in my head
[02:57.18]When we're out of touch
[03:00.17]I really really really really really really like you
[03:05.27]And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
