[00:17.22]Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
[00:20.85]And every night has its day, so magical
[00:24.54]And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
[00:28.41]That can't be defeated
[00:31.94]
[00:32.33]For every tyrant to tear upon the vulnerable
[00:35.75]In every lost soul, the bones of the miracle
[00:39.45]For every dreamer, a dream we're unstoppable
[00:43.23]With something to believe in
[00:46.66]
[00:47.89]Monday left me broken
[00:50.89]Tuesday I was through with hoping
[00:54.44]Wednesday my empty arms were open
[00:58.11]Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
[01:03.16]Bang the stars it's Friday
[01:05.45]I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
[01:09.18]Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
[01:12.90]I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
[01:17.65]To cover on
[01:18.87]
[02:24.67]For every tyrant to tear upon the vulnerable
[02:28.39]In every lost soul, the bones of the miracle
[02:32.15]For every dreamer, a dream we're unstoppable
[02:36.21]With something to believe in
[02:39.02]
[02:40.27]Monday left me broken
[02:43.22]Tuesday I was through with hoping
[02:46.63]Wednesday my empty arms were open
[02:50.33]Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
[02:55.26]Bang the stars it's Friday
[02:57.87]I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
[03:01.64]Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
[03:05.23]I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
[03:09.83]To cover on
[03:23.47]
