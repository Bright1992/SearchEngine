[00:15]Now I'm at a payphone
[00:20]Now I'm at a payphone
[00:25]Now I'm at a payphone
[00:29]Now I'm at a payphone
[00:33]Now I'm at a payphone
[00:35]I'm at a payphone trying to call home
[00:38]All of my change I spent on you
[00:43]Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
[00:47]Where are the plans we made for two
[00:52]Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
[00:55]The people we used to be
[00:58]It's even harder to picture
[01:01]That you're not here next to me
[01:03]You say it's too late to make it
[01:05]But is it too late to try
[01:07]And in our time that you wasted
[01:09]All of our bridges burned down
[01:12]I've wasted my nights
[01:14]You turned out the lights
[01:16]Now I'm paralyzed
[01:18]Still stuck in that time
[01:21]When we called it love
[01:22]But even the sun sets in paradise
[01:28]I'm at a payphone trying to call home
[01:32]All of my change I spent on you
[01:37]Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
[01:41]Where are the plans we made for two
[01:45]If "Happy Ever After" did exist
[01:50]I would still be holding you like this
[01:54]All those fairy tales are full of it
[02:00]One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
[02:04]Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
[02:07]Cause you forgot yesterday
[02:09]I gave you my love to borrow
[02:13]But you just gave it away
[02:15]You can't expect me to be fine
[02:17]I don't expect you to care
[02:19]I know I've said it before
[02:21]But all of our bridges burned down
[02:24]I've wasted my nights,
[02:26]You turned out the lights
[02:28]Now I'm paralyzed
[02:31]Still stuck in that time
[02:33]When we called it love
[02:35]But even the sun sets in paradise

[03:42]Made it from the bottom
[03:43]Now when you see me I'm stunning
[03:44]And all of my cars start with a push of a button
[03:46]Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
[03:49]Switch the number to my phone so you never could call it
[03:50]Don't need my name on my shirt you can tell it I'm ballin
[03:53]Swish, what a shame could have got picked
[03:56]Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
[03:58]So you talk about who you see at the top
[04:00]Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
[04:03]Phantom pulled up valet open doors
[04:04]Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
