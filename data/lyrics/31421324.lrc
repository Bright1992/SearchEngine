[00:00.680]Never thought that we would end up here
[00:03.620]Shoulda known it from the start
[00:05.510]
[00:06.530]I know you mean it when you say you love me
[00:09.870]But we're trying way too hard
[00:11.930]
[00:12.940]Used to think that we would last forever
[00:15.970]How could I have been so wrong
[00:17.980]
[00:19.130]Never thought I'd be the one to say this
[00:21.980]What if our time has come and gone
[00:23.810]
[00:24.96]You,
[00:26.55]you don't mean no harm
[00:29.51]But you're stringin' me along,
[00:31.84]and I don't have the time to spare
[00:34.410]
[00:36.730]And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
[00:41.350]But you're suffocating me
[00:43.670]This time I'm coming up for air
[00:46.950]
[00:55.960]Always tryna put your two cents in
[00:59.080]And expecting me to change
[01:01.060]
[01:02.040]Tried to fix me up but I'm not broken
[01:05.200]All you do is leave me stained
[01:07.150]
[01:08.220]Told you not to tell me that too quickly
[01:11.310]Take it slow, it's not a race
[01:13.400]
[01:14.420]And you keep tryna reel me in but
[01:17.540]All I really need is space
[01:19.650]
[01:20.56]You,
[01:21.92]you don't mean no harm
[01:24.79]But you're stringin' me along,
[01:32.04]and I don't have the time to spare
[01:36.700]But you're suffocating me
[01:39.080]This time I'm coming up for air
[01:42.250]
[01:57.930]Tried to hold me down but I'm surfacing
[02:02.840]
[02:04.050]Time to let me go but I gotta leave
[02:09.470]You, you don't mean no harm
[02:13.640]But you're stringing me along
[02:16.040]And I don't have the time to spare
[02:20.100]
[02:21.440]And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
[02:25.960]But you're suffocating me
[02:28.940]I'm coming up for air
[02:32.210]
[02:34.200]You, you don't mean no harm
[02:38.250]But you're stringing me along
[02:40.580]And I don't have the time to spare, yeah
[02:45.070]
[02:45.990]And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
[02:49.580]I'm trying hard to breathe
[02:51.250]Suffocating me
[02:52.890]This time I'm coming up for air
