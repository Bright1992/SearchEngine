[00:00.640]Imagination
[00:06.120]
[00:09.220]Oh, there she goes again
[00:11.990]Every morning it's the same
[00:14.230]
[00:15.330]You walk on by my house
[00:17.980]I wanna call out your name
[00:20.480]
[00:21.950]I want to tell you how beautiful
[00:25.310]You are from where I'm standing
[00:27.820]
[00:28.630]You got me thinking what we could be 'cause
[00:32.290]I keep craving, craving
[00:34.890]You don't know it but it's true
[00:38.290]Can't get my mouth to say the words
[00:41.250]They want to say to you
[00:44.020]This is typical of love
[00:46.070]
[00:46.610]Can't wait anymore
[00:47.920]I won't wait I need to tell you
[00:49.490]How I feel when I see us together forever
[00:52.680]In my dreams you're with me
[00:57.100]
[00:57.960]We'll be everything I want us to be
[01:02.470]
[01:03.280]And from there, who knows
[01:07.640]
[01:08.950]Maybe this will be the night
[01:11.280]That we kiss for the first time
[01:14.650]Or is that just me and my imagination
[01:20.650]We walk, we laugh
[01:21.980]We spend our time walking by the ocean side
[01:26.200]Our hands are gently intertwined
[01:28.890]A feeling I just can't describe
[01:31.640]All this time we spent alone
[01:34.250]Thinking we could not belong to something
[01:37.420]So damn beautiful
[01:39.320]
[01:40.080]So damn beautiful
[01:41.610]I keep craving, craving, you don't know it, but it's true
[01:47.320]
[01:48.070]Can't get my mouth to say the words
[01:50.590]They want to say to you
[01:53.250]This is typical of love
[01:55.320]
[01:55.930]Can't wait anymore
[01:57.200]I won't wait I need to tell you
[01:58.800]How I feel when I see us together forever
[02:01.260]

[02:06.370]
[02:07.270]We'll be everything I want us to be
[02:11.800]
[02:12.580]And from there
[02:14.350]
[02:15.290]Who knows
[02:16.850]
[02:18.220]Maybe this will be the night
[02:20.710]That we kiss for the first time
[02:23.950]Or is that just me and my imagination
[02:32.030]
[02:32.730]Imagination
[02:37.040]
[02:37.960]Imagination
[02:40.370]
[02:50.110]In my dreams, you're with me
