[00:15.320]Yes, I do, I believe
[00:18.200]That one day I will be where I was
[00:21.430]Right there, right next to you
[00:23.500]And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
[00:27.250]The moon, the stars are nothing without you
[00:31.140]Your touch, your skin,
[00:32.860]Where do I begin?
[00:35.030]No words can explain the way I’m missing you
[00:39.800]Deny this emptiness, this hole that I’m inside
[00:43.570]These tears, they tell their own story
[00:46.860]You told me not to cry when you were gone
[00:54.000]But the feeling’s overwhelming, they're much too strong
[01:02.000]Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
[01:23.540]I’ll take care of you
[01:48.440]I’m reaching out to you
[01:55.000]Can you hear my call?
[02:04.310]This hurt that I’ve been through
[02:09.500]I’m missing you, missing you like crazy
[02:19.000]Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
[02:36.010]Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
[02:51.650]Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
[03:06.980]Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
[03:22.200]Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
