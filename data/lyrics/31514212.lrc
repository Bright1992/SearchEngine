[00:26.14]Raging again
[00:28.03]And I'm dressed in trouble
[00:30.45]Lost for a name
[00:32.13]But I've met my double
[00:34.25]I'd like to get to know you first my love
[00:40.40]
[00:43.02]Spending our days
[00:44.86]In our tranquil bubble
[00:47.20]Lost in your gaze
[00:49.05]And I'm dumbstruck
[00:50.38]But you're radiantly beautiful my love
[00:57.14]
[00:59.32]my love
[01:03.65]Johanna
[01:07.11]You're such a pretty picture
[01:11.93]Johanna
[01:15.27]Stole my heart away
[01:19.53]You stole my heart away
[01:23.82]
[01:38.00]Stealing away
[01:39.86]In a midnight fever
[01:42.23]Nowhere to go
[01:43.99]But I've got to leave her
[01:46.23]I'm ready to apologise my love
[01:53.12]
[01:54.95]Counting my fears
[01:56.79]But I've got no fingers left
[01:59.85]Through here, all alone with my guilt
[02:03.21]I'm dying to share everything with you
[02:09.73]
[02:15.64]Johanna
[02:19.00]You're such a pretty picture
[02:23.97]Johanna
[02:27.16]You stole my heart away
[02:31.46]You stole my heart away
[02:35.91]
[02:50.44]I've been ruined by the things I've seen
[02:54.23]You've got rhythm but it won't hold me
[02:58.56]I'm not amazed but I'm on my knees
[03:01.84]And I feel
[03:03.91]And I feel
[03:06.26]Johanna
[03:09.74]You're such a pretty picture
[03:14.71]Johanna
[03:18.14]You stole my heart away
[03:23.22]Johanna
[03:26.77]You're such a pretty picture
[03:31.68]Johanna
[03:34.89]You stole my heart away
[03:39.05]You stole my heart away
