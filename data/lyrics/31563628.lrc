[00:13.230]When tomorrow comes
[00:14.600]I'll be on my own
[00:16.100]Feeling frightened up
[00:17.650]The things that I don't know
[00:19.410]When tomorrow comes
[00:21.280]Tomorrow comes
[00:22.890]Tomorrow comes
[00:25.920]And though the road is long
[00:27.510]I look up to the sky
[00:29.080]In the dark I found, I stop and I won’t fly
[00:32.300]And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along
[00:39.060]I got all I need when I got you and I
[00:42.290]I look around me, and see sweet life
[00:45.490]I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
[00:48.750]You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
[00:52.230]Can’t stop my heart when you shinin’ in my eyes
[00:55.490]Can’t lie, it’s a sweet life
[00:58.720]I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
[01:01.530]You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
[01:06.650]Cause you're my flash light
[01:09.680]You're my flash light, you're my flash light
[01:18.170]I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
[01:21.130]I'm not the afraid when the rain won't stop
[01:24.260]Cause you light the way
[01:26.370]You light the way, you light the way
[01:30.710]I got all I need when I got you and I
[01:34.190]I look around me, and see sweet life
[01:37.520]I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
[01:40.580]You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
[01:44.280]Can’t stop my heart when you shinin’ in my eyes
[01:47.370]Can’t lie, it’s a sweet life
[01:50.560]I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
[01:53.530]You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
[01:57.620]Cause you're my flash light
[02:00.410]You're my flash light, you're my flash light
[02:13.860]I got all I need when I got you and I
[02:16.480]I look around me, and see sweet life
[02:18.760]I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
[02:19.750]You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
[02:23.100]Can’t stop my heart when you shinin’ in my eyes
[02:26.280]Can’t lie, it’s a sweet life
[02:29.570]I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
[02:32.670]You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
[02:36.050]Cause you're my flash light
[02:40.380]You're my flash light, you're my flash light
[03:01.060]you're my flash light
