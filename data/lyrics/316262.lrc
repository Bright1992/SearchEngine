[00:39.900]here i stand in bressanone
[00:46.000]with the stars up in the sky
[00:51.000]are they shining over brenner
[00:57.400]and upon the other side
[01:02.500]you would be a sweet surrender
[01:08.200]i must go the other way
[01:13.900]and my train will carry me onward
[01:20.000]though my heart would surely stay
[01:24.900]wo my heart would surely stay
[02:26.800]now the clouds are flying by me
[02:33.100]and the moon is on the rise
[02:39.000]i have left stars behind me
[02:44.100]they were disamondsin your skies
[02:53.000]you would be a sweet surrender
[02:58.300]i must go the other way
[03:03.600]and my train will carry me onward
[03:09.600]though my heart would surely stay
[03:15.300]wo my heart would surely stay
[03:23.300]here i stand in bressanone
[03:29.300]with the stars up in the sky
[03:35.300]are they shining over brenner
[03:40.300]wo my heart would surely stay
[03:46.300]wo my heart would surely stay
