[00:12.230]It's been a long day without you my friend
[00:19.100]And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
[00:25.160]We've come a long way from where we began
[00:31.170]Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
[00:37.520]When I see you again
[00:42.290]Why'd you have to leave so soon?
[00:45.380]Why'd you have to go?
[00:48.470]Why'd you have to leave me when I needed you the most?
[00:54.380]
[00:54.390]'Cause I don't really know how to tell you, without feeling much worse
[01:00.650]
[01:00.660]I know you're in a better place
[01:02.740]But it's always gonna hurt
[01:05.340]Carry on
[01:08.980]Give me all the strength that I need to carry on
[01:17.840]It's been a long day without you my friend
[01:24.310]And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

[02:00.470]How do I breathe without you
[02:03.050]I'm feeling so cold
[02:05.030]I'll be waiting right here for you
[02:08.810]Till the day you're home
[02:10.270]Carry on
[02:14.240]Give me all the strength I need to carry on
[02:23.000]So let the light guide your way
[02:28.130]Hold every memory as you go
[02:34.670]And every road you take will always lead you home
[02:47.830]It's been a long day without you my friend
[02:54.600]And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
[03:00.780]We've come a long way from where we began
[03:06.790]Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
[03:12.990]When I see you again, see you again
[03:33.300]When I see you again
