[00:08.290]Stars fall at my feet, keep me grounded as I reach
[00:16.970]Higher than I see, is there something there for me?
[00:24.560]Pulling back the reins, letting go again
[00:33.010]I'm not afraid, I'm not
[00:38.140]All my life, one page at a time
[00:45.210]I'll show you my, my true colours
[00:51.570]No I won't apologise for the fire in my eyes
[00:59.910]Let me show you my, my true colours, it ain't no rainbow
[01:10.220]A promise with the light, is broken by design
[01:18.070]What we thought we knew, has been swallowed by the truth
[01:25.380]It's time to light the flame, right before it rains
[01:33.990]I'm not afraid, I'm not
[01:39.120]All my life, one page at a time
[01:46.190]I'll show you my, my true colours
[01:53.800]No I won't apologise for the fire in my eyes
[02:01.270]Let me show you my, my true colours, it ain't no rainbow
[02:10.260]Something tells me, I know nothing at all
[02:18.510]We've escaped our capture
[02:22.160]Yet we have our masters
[02:26.300]And somehow it's like I've waited
[02:32.190]All my life, one page at a time
[02:39.560]I'll show you my, my true colours
[02:47.270]No I won't apologise for the fire in my eyes
[02:54.380]Let me show you my, my true colours, it ain't no rainbow
