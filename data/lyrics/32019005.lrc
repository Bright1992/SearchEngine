[00:03.550]Baby, if you're done with love, who's gonna hold you tonight?
[00:11.450]Are you done with love so they can't hurt you tomorrow?
[00:18.320]You don't wanna keep on swimming in the ocean you've cried
[00:26.500]But I won't let you drown, I'll pull you back to the shallow
[00:33.320]Cause all I ever really wanted
[00:40.040]In this short life was you
[00:48.300]Tell me who took your heart away
[00:51.290]And do you know it breaks mine when I hear you say
[00:54.970]That you're done with love?
[00:58.410]Oh, you are done with love
[01:03.330]Give me one night to mend the pain
[01:06.220]Because the second we touch, you'll forget the day
[01:09.900]You were done with love
[01:13.430]Oh, you were done with love
[01:17.940]If you were down with love
[01:48.410]Woah,Give me one night to mend the pain
[01:51.350]Because the second we touch, you'll forget the day
[01:55.230]You were done with love
[01:58.570]Oh, you were done with love
[02:18.410]Don't I ever really wanted
[02:24.950]In this short life was you
[02:33.420]Don't I ever really wanted
[02:39.980]In this short life was you
[03:02.670]Woah,Give me one night to mend the pain
[03:06.350]Because the second we touch, you'll forget the day
[03:10.130]You were done with love
[03:13.420]Oh, you were done with love
[03:17.800]If you're done with love
[03:47.560]Woah,Give me one night to mend the pain
[03:51.240]Because the second we touch, you'll forget the day
[03:55.070]You were done with love
[03:58.410]Oh, you were done with love
