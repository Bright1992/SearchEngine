[00:55.320]I was staring at the ceiling
[00:59.000]You're so pretty when you're mad
[01:02.680]All that I can hear is breathing
[01:06.060]Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
[01:10.490]And we're stuck inside the silence
[01:14.270]In a cold cold war
[01:17.950]We're too proud to say we're sorry
[01:21.220]Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
[01:23.890]
[01:25.650]Right now it feels like we're bleeding
[01:29.190]So deep that we might not get back up
[01:32.920]Our words will tear through the surface
[01:36.550]Like a paper, like a papercut
[01:40.590]Right now I don't know why I love you
[01:44.280]But by the morning when we wake up
[01:48.160]I'll reach for you and remember
[01:51.210]It was just a paper, just a papercut
[01:55.400]
[02:11.740]I find refuge in a distance
[02:15.320]Even when we're breaking down (down, down, down, down)
[02:19.070]Can't we pause it just for one kiss
[02:22.290]Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
[02:26.680]Cause I never meant to hurt you
[02:30.310]And I know you feel the same
[02:34.140]Still the only one I run to
[02:37.430]Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
[02:40.590]
[02:41.970]Right now it feels like we're bleeding
[02:45.690]So deep that we might not get back up
[02:49.430]Our words will tear through the surface
[02:52.960]Like a paper, like a papercut
[02:57.090]Right now I don't know why I love you
[03:00.870]But by the morning when we wake up
[03:04.650]I'll reach for you and remember
[03:08.140]It was just a paper, just a papercut
[03:11.410]
[05:51.270]Right now it feels like we're bleeding
[05:55.310]So deep that we might not get back up
[05:59.130]Our words will tear through the surface
[06:02.610]Like a paper, like a papercut
[06:06.860]Right now I don't know why I love you
[06:10.490]But by the morning when we wake up
[06:14.320]I'll reach for you and remember
[06:18.000]It was just a paper, just a papercut
[06:22.420]
[06:25.810]Just a paper, just a papercut
[06:33.430]Just a paper, just a papercut
[06:40.690]Just a paper, just a papercut
[06:48.220]Just a paper, just a papercut
