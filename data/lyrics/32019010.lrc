[00:07.600]It feels like the fairytale is over
[00:11.500]I really wanted these pages to begin
[00:16.260]With "Once upon a time"
[00:20.050]like all those lullabies
[00:23.990]I should've known better
[00:26.540]I'll admit it, I thought when I let you in
[00:31.310]You were my shining knight from all those stories
[00:39.290]This love is your illusion
[00:46.670]this love is your illusion
[00:52.250]Take me to a place with real-life love
[00:56.240]I need a break from this broken-down fantasy
[00:59.980]Show me a place I can realize love, not your illusion
[02:37.730]It feels like the fairytale is over
[02:41.450]I really wanted these pages to begin
[02:46.420]With "Once upon a time"
[02:50.240]like all those lullabies
[02:54.050]I should've known better
[02:56.730]I'll admit it, I thought when I let you in
[03:01.240]You were my shining knight from all those stories
[03:09.170]This love is your illusion
[03:16.610]this love is your illusion
[03:22.230]Take me to a place with real-life love
[03:26.170]I need a break from this broken-down fantasy
[03:29.860]Show me a place I can realize love, not your illusion
