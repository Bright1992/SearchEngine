[00:14.87]Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax cause
[00:18.23]I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll back but
[00:21.30]All I wanna do is forget about my past and
[00:25.27]Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
[00:28.91]Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
[00:32.60]Probably cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
[00:36.10]Not really the type to let a nigga talk back but
[00:39.65]Imma let it slide cause my niggas too violent
[00:43.32]Shoutout to the ones who spend money like a habit
[00:46.74]Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
[00:50.32]Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
[00:53.86]Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
[00:57.47]Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
[01:01.09]Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
[01:04.63]Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
[01:08.28]Nobody can handle me, I'm gone when the shit's too strong
[01:12.64]The night's too long
[01:14.41]I took too much and I've gone too far
[01:17.99]And I might not make it

[01:40.90]Bitches know, told a ho, "It's different strokes for different folks"
[01:44.15]Came up out the north, we was playin' with a different snow
[01:47.62]Took my niggas from the four-one to pacific coast
[01:51.24]We no longer put no fish scale on the fishin' boat
[01:54.90]Listen ho, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke
[01:58.40](Liquor, smoke)
[01:59.37]I know all you bitches want is dick and dough
[02:01.96](Dick and dough)
[02:03.00]Told her, "You don't gotta make it difficult"
[02:05.59]Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
[02:10.50]Hippy bitches sendin' me titty pictures
[02:13.19]She told me no religion was the new religion
[02:16.68]She said she don't believe in God but her shoes Christian
[02:20.23]I heard she servin' everybody like the soup kitchen
[02:23.68]Gettin' hoes higher, gettin' hoes higher
[02:26.98]She got work in the mornin', I'm gettin' hoes fired
[02:30.63]Why the fuck you call it purp when you mix it pink?
[02:34.64]You know I fuckin' mix the drinks when the shit's too strong
[02:38.91]The night's too long
[02:40.61]I took too much and I've gone too far
[02:43.95]And I might not make it
[02:46.62]I might not make it
