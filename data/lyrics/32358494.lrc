[00:36.340]Take me to the finish line
[00:39.430]Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take
[00:42.670]But I’m hoping at the gates, they’ll tell me that you’re mine
[00:46.880]
[00:48.380]Walking through the city streets
[00:52.340]Is it by mistake or design?
[00:55.160]I feel so alone on a Friday night
[00:58.840]Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you’re mine
[01:02.810]It’s like I told you honey
[01:04.850]Don’t make me sad, don’t make me cry
[01:08.720]Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
[01:11.880]I don’t know why
[01:12.820]Keep making me laugh, let’s go get high
[01:16.280]The road is long, we carry on

[01:20.370]Come and take a walk on the wild side
[01:22.430]Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
[01:25.340]You like your girls insane
[01:28.410]Choose your last words
[01:30.740]This is the last time
[01:32.880]Cause you and I, we were born to die
