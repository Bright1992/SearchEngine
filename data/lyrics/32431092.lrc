[01:06.690]I see what you're wearing, there's nothing beneath it
[01:10.050]Forgive me for staring, forgive me for breathing
[01:14.030]We might not know why, we might not know how
[01:17.670]But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
[01:20.920]We're beautiful now
[01:24.870]We're beautiful now
[01:28.810]We might not know why, we might not know how
[01:32.610]But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
[01:35.960]We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds
[01:39.760]'Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now,
[01:43.650] we're beautiful
[01:59.030]We're beautiful
[02:13.740]Wherever it's going, I'm gonna chase it
[02:17.440]What's left of this moment, I'm not gonna waste it
[02:20.670]Stranded together, our worlds have collided
[02:24.230]This won't be forever, so why try to fight it
[02:28.220]We're beautiful now
[02:31.860]We're beautiful now
[02:35.760]We might not know why, we might not know how
[02:39.400]But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
[02:43.200]We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds
[02:46.940]'Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now, we're beautiful
[03:06.130]We're beautiful
[03:38.450]Let's live tonight like fireflies
[03:41.940]And one by one light up the sky
[03:45.490]We disappear and pass the crown
[03:49.490]You're beautiful, you're beautiful
[03:51.560]We're beautiful now
[03:55.080]We're beautiful now
[03:58.690]We're beautiful now
[04:02.440]We're beautiful now
[04:06.380]We're beautiful
[04:13.530]We're beautiful
[04:22.160]We're beautiful now
[04:24.790]We're beautiful now
[04:28.880]We're beautiful now
[04:32.580]We're beautiful now
[04:36.330]We're beautiful now
[04:38.630]We're beautiful
