[00:01.63]
[00:16.22]Died last night in my dreams
[00:18.46]
[00:19.03]Walking the streets of some old ghost town
[00:22.95]
[00:24.10]I tried to believe
[00:26.85]In god and James Dean
[00:29.03]But Hollywood sold out
[00:30.95]
[00:31.98]Saw all of the saints
[00:34.50]
[00:35.07]Lock up the gates
[00:36.57]
[00:37.17]I could not enter
[00:38.98]
[00:40.17]Walked into the flames
[00:42.97]Called out your name
[00:44.97]But there was no answer
[00:46.87]
[00:48.02]And now I know
[00:49.74]My heart is a ghost town
[00:52.18]
[00:56.04]Now I know
[00:57.52]My heart is a ghost town
[01:00.15]Ghost town
[01:01.02]
[01:15.28]Ghost town
[01:16.00]
[01:23.29]Ghost town
[01:24.13]
[01:31.35]Ghost town
[01:31.99]
[01:39.30]Ghost town
[01:39.98]
[01:48.18]Died last night in my dreams
[01:50.26]
[01:50.90]All the machines
[01:52.13]
[01:52.82]Had been disconnected
[01:54.75]
[01:55.98]Time was thrown at the wind
[01:58.29]
[01:58.82]And all of my friends
[02:00.86]Had been disaffected
[02:02.80]
[02:03.81]Now I'm searching for trust
[02:06.82]In a city of rust
[02:08.79]A city of vampires
[02:11.79]Tonight Elvis is dead
[02:14.76]And everyone's spread
[02:16.77]And love is a satire
[02:18.89]
[02:19.88]And now I know my heart is a ghost town
[02:23.96]
[02:29.65]My heart is a ghost town
[02:32.07]
[02:37.01]Ooh My heart is a ghost town
[02:40.05]
[02:47.18]Ghost town
[02:47.94]
[02:54.10]My heart is a ghost town
[02:55.95]
[02:56.53]There's no one left in the world
[02:58.48]I'm gunslingin
[03:00.42]Don't give a fuck if I go
[03:02.54]Down Down Down
[03:03.89]
[03:04.43]I got a voice in my head
[03:06.62]That keeps singing
[03:07.45]
[03:07.99]Oh my heart is a ghost town
[03:11.97]
[03:17.80]My heart is a ghost town
[03:19.86]
[03:25.73]My heart is a ghost town
[03:27.98]
[03:31.59]My heart
[03:32.29]
[03:33.52]My heart is a ghost town
[03:35.89]
[03:41.57]My heart is a ghost town
