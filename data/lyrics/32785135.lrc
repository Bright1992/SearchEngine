[00:06.480]Loving can hurt
[00:10.330]Loving can hurt sometimes
[00:14.520]But it's the only thing that I know
[00:23.210]When it gets hard
[00:26.250]You know it can get hard sometimes
[00:30.690]It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
[00:39.900]We keep this love in a photograph
[00:43.940]We made these memories for ourselves
[00:46.940]Where our eyes are never closing
[00:49.390]Hearts are never broken
[00:51.390]Times forever frozen still
[00:55.030]So you can keep me
[00:57.570]Inside the pocket
[00:59.430]Of your ripped jeans
[01:01.720]Holdin' me closer
[01:03.200]'Til our eyes meet
[01:05.650]You won't ever be alone
[01:11.050]And if you hurt me
[01:13.880]That's OK, baby, only words bleed
[01:17.640]Inside these pages you just hold me
[01:22.180]And I won't ever let you go
[01:25.700]Wait for me to come home
[01:43.210]Loving can heal
[01:46.410]Loving can mend your soul
[01:50.640]And it's the only thing that I know (know)
[01:58.220]I swear it will get easier
[02:01.810]Remember that with every piece of ya
[02:06.820]And it's the only thing we take with us when we die
[02:14.620]Oh you can fit me
[02:17.250]Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
[02:21.580]Next to your heartbeat
[02:23.260]Where I should be
[02:25.480]Keep it deep within your soul
[02:45.810]Wait for me to come home
[02:49.680]Wait for me to come home
[02:53.590]Wait for me to come home
[02:57.850]Wait for me to come home
[03:02.710]When I'm away
[03:05.810]I will remember how you kissed me
[03:09.940]Under the lamppost
[03:11.570]Back on 6th street
[03:13.720]Hearing you whisper through the phone,
[03:17.850]"Wait for me to come home."
