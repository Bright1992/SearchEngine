[00:08.95]I was never one to want to put my trust in someone else completely
[00:17.43]And I was always one to want to up and run when someone said they needed me
[00:25.66]But you
[00:30.71]You could be the one
[00:32.45]You could be the one
[00:34.90]Baby let's go get lost
[00:36.65]I like the way you're drivin' slow
[00:39.30]Keeping my fingers crossed
[00:41.05]That maybe you'll take the long way home
[00:44.33]Let's get lost
[00:45.58]I don't wanna let you go
[00:48.03]Keeping my fingers crossed
[00:49.78]That maybe you'll take the long way home
[00:53.01](ohhhhhhhhh)
[00:58.86]Baby let's take the long way home
[01:01.22]I was always shy and careful ,I was sure that you would never look at me
[01:09.86]Never wanted to discourage everything your eyes encouraged silently
[01:18.10]But you
[01:23.19]You could be the one
[01:24.74]You could be the one
[01:27.19]Baby let's go get lost

[01:33.18]That maybe you'll take the long way home
[01:36.50]Let's get lost
[01:37.75]I don't wanna let you go
