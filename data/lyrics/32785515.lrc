[00:03.000]I used to be in love with you
[00:08.080]You use to be the first thing on my mind
[00:13.170]I know I’m just a friend to you
[00:18.370]That I will never get to call you mine
[00:22.940]But I still love you
[00:24.400]I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I love you
[00:26.340]I didn’t mean to say what I said
[00:28.880]I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
[00:31.530]But I can’t get you out of my head
[00:33.820]And I want you to miss me
[00:36.480]When I’m not around you
[00:39.230]I know that you’re in town
[00:40.720]Why won't you come around
[00:41.860]To the spot that we met
[00:43.650]I’m not the type of girl for you
[00:46.500]And I’m not going to pretend
[00:49.090]That I’m the type of girl you call more  than a friend
[00:54.070]And I break all the rules for you
[00:56.800]Break my heart and start again
[00:59.700]I’m not the type of girl you call more  than a friend
[01:05.570]I bet she acts so perfectly
[01:10.860]You probably eat up every word she says
[01:16.200]And if you ever think of me
[01:21.250]I bet I’m just a flicker in your head
[01:25.690]But I still love you
[01:27.190]I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I love you
[01:29.130]I didn’t mean to say what I said
[01:31.720]I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
