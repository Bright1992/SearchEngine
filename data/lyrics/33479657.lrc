[00:18.65][Verse 1]
[00:19.43]I'm feeling something, something different
[00:23.98]When you left, I'd appeared to change
[00:28.88]I was blinded, I'd not envisioned
[00:33.05]The same face in a different frame
[00:36.23]
[00:36.94][Pre-Chorus]
[00:39.14]It's an omen, caught my baby crying

[00:47.24]It must be an omen
[00:51.06]Needed you to show me that you are an omen
[00:55.24]
[00:55.78][Chorus]
[01:00.65]Not like you'd broke my heart
[01:04.34]I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
[01:09.60]It left me torn apart
[01:13.45]But now I see your tears are an omen
[01:16.35]

[01:47.94]You're relocating and I need you by my side
[01:53.40]
[01:53.97][Pre-Chorus]
[01:55.94]It's an omen, caught my baby crying
[02:01.15]Saw the silver lining
[02:04.60]It must be an omen
[02:07.92]Needed you to show me that you are an omen
[02:11.85]
[02:12.48][Chorus]
[02:17.51]Not like you'd broke my heart
[02:21.35]I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
[02:26.67]It left me torn apart
[02:30.27]But now I see your tears are an omen
[02:35.62]Not like you'd broke my heart
[02:39.25]I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
[02:44.94]It left me torn apart
[02:48.44]But now I see your tears are an omen
[02:51.52]
