[00:34.88]I'm slippin' down a chain reaction

[00:46.34]
[00:46.81]Honey, it's rainin' tonight
[00:49.27]

[01:19.05]
[01:19.21]You and me run the same course
[01:21.36]
[02:07.27]I'm better under your reflection
[02:09.76]
[02:09.94]But did you know, did you know, did you know, know
[02:12.76]
[02:12.92]That's anybody else that's met ya
[02:15.61]
[02:15.76]It's all the same, all the same, all the same glow
[02:18.32]
[02:18.63]Honey, it's rainin' tonight
[02:21.00]

[02:32.93]You and me bleed the same light
[02:34.68]
[02:34.87]I want you to know that I'm all yours
[02:38.29]
[02:38.50]You and me, we're the same force

[02:43.91]
[02:44.03]You and me bleed the same light
