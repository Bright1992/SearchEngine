[00:10]If you get lonely,
[00:14]think of me only.
[00:16]Prison isnâ€™t going to keep me from you.
[00:21]Remember Cooney Island and how we
[00:26]Went into the water till the waves turned blue
[00:31]Nobody does have to know
[00:35]that our loves a lie
[00:37]Keep it on the low
[00:40]if you want to hide
[00:42]Got that same address
[00:45]if you want to ride to on Greenwich avenue
[00:50]wishing and thinking of you
[00:53][02:05][02:46]Living without you is like Tv in black and white.
[00:58][02:10][02:51]you turn me on and brought color into my life
[01:03][02:15][02:56]When I'm around you suddenly I realize
[01:08][02:20][03:01]that I was blind before
[01:11][02:23][03:04]I saw the world through your eyes.
[01:23]If you get lonely think of this only,
[01:28]Heaven hasn't forgot about you
[01:34]Though you cant hold me pick up and phone me,
[01:39]Use your one phone call on your ex girl, boo~
[01:44]I wont tell a single soul,
[01:47]how you spend your nights
[01:50]In that single cell
[01:52]holding you pillow tight
[01:55]If you really are afraid then you ought to know
[02:00]That you're the one I want,
[02:22] forever more
[02:26]I know you get scares sometimes,boy.
[02:31]Nothing to be feared when your in my heart.
[02:37]Troubles come in threes but in your case.
[02:41]They come in millions and trillions,
[02:44]but that's all right.
[03:09][03:14][03:19][03:25]Like Tv in black and white.
