[00:01.08]My mind runs away to you
[00:03.65]With a thought I hope you'll see
[00:07.26]Can't see where it's wandered to
[00:10.51]But I know where it wants to be
[00:13.25]I'm waiting patiently
[00:16.31]Though time is moving slow
[00:19.68]I have one vacancy
[00:23.17]And I wanted you to know
[00:25.54]That you're the one
[00:28.91]Designed for me
[00:31.97]A distant stranger
[00:35.34]That I will complete
[00:38.45]I know you're right but
[00:41.76]We're meant to be
[00:44.82]So keep your head down
[00:49.87]And make it to me
[00:51.68]
[01:18.70]Make it to me
[01:22.70]
[01:27.06]So sick of this loneliness
[01:30.30]It seems such a waste of breath
[01:33.38]So much that I need to say
[01:36.75]So much to get off my chest
[01:39.79]I'm waiting patiently
[01:42.79]Though time is moving slow
[01:46.11]I have one vacancy
[01:49.54]And I wanted you to know
[01:51.96]That you're the one
[01:55.34]Designed for me
[01:58.21]A distant stranger
[02:01.76]That I will complete
[02:04.76]I know you're right but
[02:08.06]We're meant to be
[02:11.24]So keep your head down
[02:15.74]And make it to me
[02:18.22]
[03:22.64]My mind runs away to you
[03:25.19]With a thought I hope you'll see
[03:28.62]Can't see where it's wandered to
[03:31.99]But I know where it wants to be
[03:34.99]I'm waiting patiently
[03:38.14]Though time is moving slow
[03:41.35]I have one vacancy
[03:44.78]And I wanted you to know
[03:46.97]That you're the one
[03:50.59]Designed for me
[03:53.58]A distant stranger
[03:56.95]That I will complete
[04:00.01]I know you're right but
[04:03.32]We're meant to be
[04:06.31]So keep your head down
[04:11.31]And make it to me
[04:13.54]
