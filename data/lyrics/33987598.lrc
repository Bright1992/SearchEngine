[00:09.09]You're stuck on me and my laughing eyes
[00:12.76]I can’t pretend though I try to hide
[00:16.05]I like you. I like you.
[00:24.76]I think I felt my heart skip a beat
[00:28.67]I'm standing here and I can hardly breathe
[00:32.07][03:44.27][03:52.14]You got me. You got me.
[00:40.60]The way you take my hand is just so sweet
[00:48.56]And that crooked smile of yours
[00:52.53]it knocks me off my feet
[00:56.13][01:59.53][02:48.98][03:13.59]Oh, I just can’t get enough
[01:00.82][02:04.36][02:53.79][03:17.61]I'm a ** I need to fill me up.
[01:04.50][02:08.13][02:57.74][03:21.69]It feels so good it must be love
[01:08.75][02:12.00]It’s everything that I’ve been dreaming of.
[01:11.88][02:14.65][03:28.44]I give up. I give in. I let go.
[01:14.45][02:17.88][03:31.26]Let’s begin.
[01:15.48][02:18.75]Cuz no matter what i do,
[01:19.28][02:22.72][03:38.79][03:42.47][03:48.09]Oh (oh)
[01:21.59][02:25.02][03:39.17]My heart is filled with you.
[01:28.29]I can’t imagine what it'd be like
[01:32.24]Livin’ each day in this life
[01:35.59]Without you. Without you.
[01:44.16]One look from you
[01:46.21]I know you understand
[01:52.16]This mess we're in you know
[01:54.54]is just so out of hand.
[02:31.99]I hope we always feel this way
[02:37.79](I know we will)
[02:39.88]And in my heart I know you’ll always stay
[03:04.63]I give up. I give in. I let go. Let’s begin.
[03:08.30][03:32.13]Cuz no matter what I do,
[03:25.47](It’s everything that I've been dreaming of)
