[00:20.81]When I look up from my pillow
[00:24.39]I dream you are there with me
[00:32.58]Though you are far away
[00:35.45]I know you'll always be near to me
[00:43.09]I go to sleep
[00:50.06]And imagine that you're there with me
[00:55.15]I go to sleep
[01:02.33]And imagine that you're there with me
[01:14.95]I look around me
[01:17.71]And feel you are ever so close to me
[01:27.13]Each tear that flows from my eye
[01:31.00]Brings back memories of you to me
[01:37.91]I go to sleep
[01:44.57]And imagine that you're there with me
[01:49.59]I go to sleep
[01:56.84]And imagine that you're there with me
[02:03.08]I was wrong, I will cry
[02:07.75]I will love you till the day I die
[02:12.16]You were all, you alone and no one else
[02:16.61]You were meant for me
[02:27.09]When morning comes again
[02:31.15]I have the loneliness you left me
[02:39.11]Each day drags by
[02:41.43]Until finally my time descends on me
[02:49.76]I go to sleep
[02:56.89]And imagine that you're there with me
[03:01.72]I go to sleep
[03:09.04]And imagine that you're there with me
