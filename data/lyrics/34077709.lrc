[00:05.34]All alone she was living
[00:08.28]In a world without an end or beginning
[00:12.67]Babygirl was living life for the feeling
[00:16.81]But I don't mind, I don't mind
[00:22.25]And all the wrongs she committed
[00:25.32]She was numb and she was so co-dependent
[00:29.72]She was young and all she had was the city
[00:33.96]But I don't mind, I don't mind
[00:38.80]And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
[00:46.79]But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone
[00:56.61]In the night she hears him calling
[01:00.93]In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
[01:07.83]She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
[01:13.76]In the night when she comes crawling
[01:18.15]Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
[01:24.89]She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
[01:33.12]He sang a song when he did it
[01:36.11]He was cold and he was so unforgiving
[01:40.48]Now she dances to the song on the minute
[01:44.70]Yeah, all the time, all the time
[01:50.16]It make her weak when she hear it
[01:53.28]And it got her on her knees like religion
[01:57.51]She was young and she was forced to be a woman
[02:01.77]Yeah, all the time, all the time
[02:06.80]And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
[02:14.76]But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone
[02:24.50]In the night she hears him calling
[02:28.77]In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
[02:35.66]She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
[02:41.60]In the night when she comes crawling
[02:46.16]Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
[02:52.78]She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
[02:60.20]I don't think you understand...
[03:15.94]In the night she hears him calling
[03:20.24]In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
[03:27.32]She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
[03:33.30]In the night when she comes crawling
[03:37.37]Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
[03:44.28]She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
