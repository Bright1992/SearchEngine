[00:00.00]
[00:25.30]Waking up, half past five
[00:30.76]Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
[00:36.24]Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
[00:41.69]But you should've seen the other guy
[00:47.04]This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
[00:52.19]Baby I'm just being honest
[00:57.42]And I know my lies could not make you believe
[01:02.10]We're running in circles that's why
[01:07.27]In my dark times I'll be going back to the street
[01:12.44]Promising everything I do not mean
[01:17.89]In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
[01:23.50]And only my mother could love me for me
[01:28.77]In my dark times, in my dark times
[01:40.37]Light one up, let me bum a smoke
[01:46.36]Still calming down, dripping throat
[01:51.74]I got another man's blood on my clothes
[01:57.47]But an endless fog's the life I chose
[02:02.58]This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
[02:07.48]Baby I'm just being honest
[02:13.24]And I know my lies could not make you believe
[02:17.82]Running in circles, that's why
[02:23.15]In my dark times I'll be going back to these streets
[02:28.82]Promising everything I do not mean
[02:33.60]In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
[02:39.53]Only my mother could love me for me
[02:44.55]In my dark times, in my dark times
[02:55.32]In my dark times I've still got some problems I know
[03:01.09]Driving too fast but just moving too slow
[03:06.31]And I've got something I've been trying to let go
[03:11.76]Pulling me back every time
[03:21.45]In my dark times taking it back to the street
[03:27.85]Making those promises that I could not keep
[03:32.41]In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
[03:38.39]Only my mother could love me for me)
[03:43.41]In my dark times taking it down to the street
[03:49.23]Making those promises that I would not keep
[03:53.80]In my dark times this is all I could be
[03:59.90]Only my mother could've loved me for me
[04:04.85]In my dark times, in my dark times
[04:15.85]In my dark times
