[00:01.00][Verse 1: The Weeknd]
[00:15.87]You bring good to my lonely life, honestly
[00:22.37]It’s hard for me to look into your eyes
[00:27.00]When, I say that I would be nothing without your love
[00:36.51]I feel the rush and it’s amazing
[00:43.22][Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
[00:43.69]Maybe I’ve been always destined to end up in this place, yeah
[00:50.56]I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
[00:57.74]Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way
[01:03.68]Cause I know, all I know, all I know
[01:10.16][Chorus: The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]
[01:10.77]I’m a prisoner to my addiction
[01:17.79]I’m addicted to a life that’s so empty and so cold
[01:24.92]I’m a prisoner to my decisions
[01:31.90]Woooo, woooo, woooo
[01:43.14][Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
[01:44.80]I think I've been in Hollywood for too long
[01:51.89]Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
[01:58.93]But I would be nothing without the touch
[02:05.68]I feel the rush and it's amazing
[02:10.28][Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
[02:12.49]Maybe I’ve been always destined to end up in this place
[02:19.38]I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
[02:26.52]Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way
[02:32.25]Cause I know, all I know, all I know
[02:38.77][Chorus: The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]
[02:39.51]I’m a prisoner to my addiction
[02:46.22]I’m addicted to a life that’s so empty and so cold
[02:53.52]I’m a prisoner to my decisions
[03:00.50]Woooo, woooo, woooo
[03:07.99]I’m a prisoner to my addiction
[03:14.68]I’m addicted to a life that’s so empty and so cold
[03:21.86]I’m a prisoner to my decisions
[03:28.75]Woooo, woooo, woooo
[03:35.31][Outro: Lana Del Rey]
[03:38.47]I don't know
[03:40.97]I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
[03:52.40]And real life is stranger than my dreams
