[00:11.840]When I’m old and grown
[00:16.780]I won’t sleep alone
[00:21.670]Every single moment
[00:23.170]will be fading into you
[00:26.580]That some type of love
[00:29.260]That some type of love
[00:32.580]And I won’t sing the blues
[00:38.450]Cause all I need is you
[00:42.710]Every single question
[00:44.630]will be answered all by you
[00:47.680]That some type of love
[00:50.370]That some type of love
[00:53.190]When the world is on fire
[00:55.290]we won’t even move
[00:58.310]There is no reason
[01:00.880]if I’m here with you
[01:03.540]And when it’s said and done
[01:05.900]I’ll give me to you
[01:08.930]That some type of love
[01:11.550]That some type of love
[01:15.200]When were old and gray
[01:19.270]And our faces changed
[01:25.110]There won’t be a moment
[01:27.400]When my heart don’t feel the same
[01:30.080]That some type of love
[01:32.720]That some type of love
[01:36.100]And every story ends
[01:42.120]But we could still pretend
[01:44.950]Every single moment
[01:48.080]will be just as we had planned
[01:50.990]It was some type of love
[01:53.930]That some type of love
[01:56.870]When the world is on fire
[01:58.900]we won’t even move
[02:01.970]There is no reason
[02:04.710]if I’m here with you
[02:07.210]And when it’s said and done
[02:10.060]I’ll give me to you
[02:12.570]That some type of love
[02:19.430]That some type of love
[02:26.700]If I’m here with you
[02:30.250]Give me to you baby
[02:38.080]That some type of love
[02:40.790]That some type of love
[02:43.530]When the world is on fire
[02:46.160]we won’t even move
[02:48.810]There is no reason
[02:51.470]if I’m here with you
[02:53.820]And when it’s said and done
[02:56.760]I’ll give me to you
[02:59.330]That some type of love
[03:01.890]That some type of love
