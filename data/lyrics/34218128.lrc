[00:43.02]Talking away
[00:45.71]I don't know what I'm to say
[00:48.17]I'll say it anyway
[00:50.91]Today's another day to find you
[00:54.02]Shying away
[00:56.61]I'll be coming for your love,OK?
[00:58.47]
[00:59.54]Take on me (take on me)
[01:04.49]Take me on (take on me)
[01:09.80]I'll be gone in a day or two
[01:15.55]
[01:41.54]So needless to say
[01:44.25]I'm odds and ends
[01:45.97]But I'll be stumbling away
[01:49.57]Slowly learning that life is OK
[01:52.33]Say after me
[01:55.33]It's no better to be safe than sorry
[01:57.49]
[01:59.26]Take on me (take on me)
[02:03.01]Take me on (take on me)
[02:08.44]I'll be gone in a day or two
[02:14.87]
