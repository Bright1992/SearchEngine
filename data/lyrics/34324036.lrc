[00:19.21]I'm a flame
[00:21.58]You're the fire
[00:24.37]I'm the dark in need of light
[00:29.63]When we touch, you inspire
[00:34.58]Feel the change in me tonight
[00:39.24]So take me up, take me higher
[00:44.29]There's a world not far from here
[00:49.26]We can dance in desire
[00:54.17]Or we can burn in love tonight
[00:57.55]
[01:00.74]Our hearts are like firestones
[01:05.54]And when they strike, we feel the love
[01:10.29]Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
[01:14.84]But when they strike, we light up the world
[01:21.30]Then we light up the world
[01:28.67]
[01:39.91]Oooh we light up the world
[01:48.56]Oooh oooh
[01:52.50]World
[01:58.31]Oooh oooh
[02:01.48]Firestone
[02:03.91]
[02:05.83]I'm from X, you're from Y
[02:10.89]Perfect strangers in the night
[02:14.78]Here we are, come together
[02:20.14]To the world we'll testify
[02:23.77]
[02:26.76]Our hearts are like firestones
[02:31.32]And when they strike, we feel the love
[02:36.07]Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
[02:40.52]But when they strike, we light up the world
[02:46.64]
[03:01.02]Oooh we light up the world
[03:10.29]Oooh oooh
[03:13.84]World
[03:19.05]Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
[03:39.88]Firestone
