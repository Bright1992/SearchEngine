[00:02.14]I want you to know that it's our time
[00:06.43]You and me bleed the same light
[00:09.98]I want you to know that I'm all yours
[00:14.13]You and me run the same course
[00:17.71]I'm slippin down a chain reaction
[00:21.54]And here I go here I go here I go go
[00:25.47]And once again I'm yours in fractions
[00:29.27]It takes me down pulls me down pulls me down low
[00:33.37]Honey it's raining tonight
[00:37.02]But storms always have an eye have an eye
[00:41.02]Tell me you're covered tonight
[00:44.86]Or tell me lies tell me lies lies

[01:48.64]But did you know did you know did you know know
[01:52.61]That's anybody else that's met ya
[01:56.45]It's all the same all the same all the same glow
[02:00.47]Honey it's raining tonight
[02:04.21]But storms always have an eye have an eye
[02:08.09]Tell me you're covered tonight
[02:11.92]Or tell me lies tell me lies lies

[02:25.40]I want you to know that I'm all yours
[02:29.76]You and me we're the same force
[02:33.20]I want you to know that it's our time
[02:37.49]You and me bleed the same light
