[00:14.500]I still hear your voice around ,
[00:20.000]Like a echo
[00:22.700]Everything in a mess.
[00:27.400]Why this feeling turn so cold ,
[00:32.299]freezing in the darkness , so alone.
[00:40.250]Everytime I look into your eyes.
[00:43.450]I can tell you our love is still alive ,
[00:48.500]it's killing me.
[00:50.950]Oh Baby~
[00:53.100]Everytime you look into my eyes.
[00:56.200]I rather hear the truth than live in all your lies
[01:00.400]I'm so lost , I'm so hurt for you.
[01:04.500]How could I survive?
[01:10.500]Would it be the very last kiss?
[01:15.400]All those memories ,
[01:17.100]all those sorrows fade away.
[01:24.950]Everytime I look into your eyes.
[01:28.150]I can tell you our love is still alive ,
[01:33.200]it's killing me.

[01:37.800]Everytime you look into my eyes.
