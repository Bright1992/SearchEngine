[00:05.58]And I love you so
[00:11.67]The people ask me how
[00:18.31]How I've lived till now
[00:24.66]I tell them I don't know
[00:31.15]I guess they understand
[00:37.50]How lonely life has been
[00:43.99]But life began again
[00:50.34]The day you took my hand
[00:58.87]And yes I know
[01:05.27]how lonely life can be
[01:13.52]The shadows follow me
[01:18.27]And the night won't set me free
[01:25.32]But I don't let
[01:31.30]the evening get me down
[01:39.98]Now that you're around me
[02:45.59]And you love me too
[02:51.10]Your thoughts are just for me
[02:57.59]You set my spirit free
[03:04.74]I'm happy that you do
[03:11.20]The book of life is brief
[03:17.80]And once a page is read
[03:24.51]All but love is dead
[03:31.21]That is my believe
[03:38.73]And yes I know
[03:45.14]how lonely life can be
[03:53.61]The shadows follow me
[03:58.73]And the night won't set me free
[04:05.29]But I don't let
[04:11.75]The evening get me down
[04:19.92]Now that you're around me
[04:30.16]And I love you so
[04:36.46]The people ask me how
[04:42.75]How I've lived till now
[04:49.16]I tell them I don't know
