[00:37.64]Hurt
[00:40.32]On caution weep
[00:43.90]With bleeding sky
[00:47.57]I called your name
[00:51.41]There was no one there
[00:55.08]And in the cold and snow
[00:58.86]I saw your face
[01:03.34]And we sang a song for the little thing
[01:07.37]Magic call but the joy you bring
[01:11.10]Running it down the line
[01:14.23]Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
[01:18.51]Magic call from a pretty thing
[01:22.34]Maybe it might be time
[01:28.63]For a better day
[01:43.69]For a better day
[02:15.13]Straight from the path of love
[02:21.68]In the road of life
[02:25.50]I tumble forward
[02:29.07]But going on I'mma keep it strong
[02:36.68]I saw your face
[02:41.00]And we sang a song for the little thing
[02:44.99]Magic call but the joy you bring
[02:48.76]Running it down the line
[02:52.04]Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
[02:56.22]Magic call from a pretty thing
[02:59.99]Maybe it might be time
[03:06.05]For a better day
[03:10.07]For a better day
[03:13.56]For a better day
[03:17.43]For a better day
[03:21.00]For a better day
