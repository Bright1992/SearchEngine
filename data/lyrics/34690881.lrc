[00:41.58]All the lights in Miami begin to gleam
[00:48.79]Ruby, blue and green, neon too
[00:57.67]Everything looks better from above, my king
[01:04.73]Like aquamarine, oceans blue
[01:12.60]Ah-ah-ah-ah
[01:14.91]Ah-ah-ah-ah
[01:16.74]Cacciatore

[01:38.51]La-da-da-da-da
[01:40.55]Soft ice cream
[01:45.57]All the lights are sparkling for you it seems
[01:52.45]On the downtown scenes, shady blue
[02:01.56]Beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain
[02:08.56]Like a boss, you sang jazz and blues
[02:16.63]Ah-ah-ah-ah
[02:18.74]Ah-ah-ah-ah

[02:48.30]The summer's wild
[02:50.48]And I've been waiting for you all this time
[02:55.71]I adore you, can't you see, you're meant for me?
[03:04.38]Summer's hot but I've been cold without you
[03:09.85]I was so wrong not to tell, Medellín, tangerine dreams
[03:20.56]Catch me if you can, working on my tan, salvatore
[03:28.66]Dying by the hand of a foreign man happily
[03:36.53]Calling out my name in the summer rain, ciao amore
[03:44.66]Salvatore can wait
[03:46.68]Now it's time to eat soft ice cream
[03:52.71]Ah-ah-ah-ah
