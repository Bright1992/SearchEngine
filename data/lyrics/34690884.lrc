[00:11.650]Hmmm-mm ...
[00:16.110]Hmmm-mm ...
[00:24.790]Sometimes I wake up in the morning
[00:29.740]To red, blue, and yellow skies
[00:34.240]It's so crazy I could drink it like tequila sunrise
[00:42.710]Put on that Hotel California
[00:47.410]Dance around like I'm insane
[00:51.920]I feel free when I see no one
[00:56.290]And nobody knows my name
[01:00.250]God knows I live
[01:04.910]God knows I died
[01:09.230]God knows I begged
[01:13.440]Begged, borrowed and cried
[01:18.230]God knows I loved
[01:22.530]God knows I lied
[01:27.110]God knows I lost
[01:31.460]God gave me life
[01:35.850]And God knows I tried
[01:40.430]God knows I tried
[01:44.730]God knows I tried
[01:49.320]God knows I tried
[01:53.760]Sometimes I wake up in the morning
[01:58.520]To red, blue and yellow lights
[02:03.420]On Monday they destroyed me
[02:07.430]But by Friday I'm revived
[02:11.570]Put on that hotel California
[02:16.240]Wear my blinders in the rain
[02:20.810]I've got nothing much to live for
[02:25.160]Ever since I found my fame
[02:29.360]God knows I live
[02:33.690]God knows I died
[02:38.140]God knows I loved
[02:42.600]God knows I lied
[02:47.150]God knows I begged
[02:51.180]Begged, borrowed and cried
[02:56.300]God knows I lost
[03:00.230]God gave me life
[03:04.650]God knows I tried
[03:09.290]God knows I tried
[03:13.700]God knows I tried
[03:18.140]God knows I tried
[03:22.220]So let there be light
[03:27.000]Let there be light
[03:31.390]Light up my life
[03:35.840]Light up my life
[03:40.180]Let there be light
[03:44.990]Let there be light
[03:49.250]Light up my life
[03:53.620]Light up my life
[03:58.180]God knows I tried
[04:02.750]God knows I tried
[04:07.190]God knows I tried
[04:11.440]God knows I tried
[04:16.200]God knows I tried
[04:20.320]God knows I tried
[04:24.970]God knows I tried
[04:29.730]God knows I tried
