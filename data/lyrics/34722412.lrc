[00:02.48]Oh, oh
[00:07.14]Uh-oh-oh-oh
[00:10.94]Eh
[00:12.43]It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
[00:15.56]I don't even really know what you intended
[00:18.62]Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
[00:21.71]Poured it down, so I poured it down
[00:24.87]Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
[00:27.86]You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
[00:30.95]You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
[00:34.12]Poured it down, so I poured it down
[00:36.75]And now I don't understand it
[00:39.87]You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
[00:42.88]And I know I shouldn't say it
[00:46.06]But my heart don't understand
[00:48.24]Why I got you on my mind
[00:51.57]Why I got you on my mind
[00:54.39]Why I got you on my mind
[00:57.93]Why I got you on my mind
[00:58.71]But my heart don't understand
[01:01.05]Why I got you on my mind
[01:03.83]Why I got you on my mind
[01:06.95]Why I got you on my mind
[01:10.05]Why I got you on my mind
[01:14.82]I always hear, always hear them talking
[01:17.45]Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
[01:20.41]Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
[01:23.52]You didn't love me, no, not really
[01:26.81]Wait
[01:28.27]I could have really liked you
[01:30.16]I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
[01:32.79]It's a shame (shame), you said I was good
[01:35.74]So I poured it down, so I poured it down
[01:38.55]And now I don't understand it
[01:41.73]You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
[01:44.77]And I know I shouldn't say it
[01:47.85]But my heart don't understand
[01:50.11]Why I got you on my mind
[01:53.28]Why I got you on my mind
[01:56.30]Why I got you on my mind
[01:59.48]Why I got you on my mind
[02:00.34]But my heart don't understand
[02:02.63]Why I got you on my mind
[02:04.28]You think you know somebody
[02:05.75]Why I got you on my mind
[02:07.09]You think you know somebody
[02:08.71]Why I got you on my mind
[02:10.09]You think you know somebody
[02:12.02]Why I got you on my mi-i-i-i-ind
[02:16.13]You got yourself in a dangerous zone
[02:21.84]Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone
[02:28.05]And I still don't understand it
[02:30.96]You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
[02:34.18]And my heart don't understand it
[02:37.22]Understand it, understand it
[02:45.75]Why I got you on my mind
[02:47.44]You think you know somebody
[02:48.82]Why I got you on my mind
[02:50.19]You think you know somebody
[02:51.81]Why I got you on my mind
[02:53.32]You think you know somebody
[02:54.88]Why I got you on my mind
[02:56.09]But my heart don't understand
[02:57.96]Why I got you on my mind
[02:59.55]You think you know somebody

[03:07.40]Why I got you on my mind
[03:08.48]But my heart don't understand
[03:10.35]Why I got you on my mind
[03:11.73]You think you know somebody
[03:15.36]You think you know somebody
[03:17.19]Why I got you on my mind
[03:18.58]You think you know somebody
[03:21.83]Uh, uh, uh, uh
