[00:28.67]You're the light, you're the night
[00:30.83]You're the color of my blood
[00:33.27]You're the cure, you're the pain
[00:35.64]You're the only thing I wanna touch
[00:40.45]Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
[00:47.55]You're the fear, I don't care
[00:49.96]Cause I've never been so high
[00:52.43]Follow me to the dark
[00:55.09]Let me take you past our satellites
[00:59.27]You can see the world you brought to life, to life
[01:06.73]So love me like you do, love me like you do
[01:11.79]Love me like you do, love me like you do
[01:16.40]Touch me like you do, touch me like you do
[01:23.10]What are you waiting for?
[02:04.77]Fading in, fading out
[02:07.24]On the edge of paradise
[02:09.28]Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find
[02:16.35]Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
[02:23.38]Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
[02:28.52]Cause I'm not thinking straight
[02:33.29]My head spinning around I can't see clear no more
[02:40.15]What are you waiting for?
[02:43.32]Love me like you do, love me like you do
[02:47.79]Love me like you do, love me like you do
[02:52.48]Touch me like you do, touch me like you do
[02:59.09]What are you waiting for?
[03:02.14]Love me like you do, love me like you do
[03:06.90]Love me like you do, love me like you do
[03:11.65]Touch me like you do, touch me like you do
[03:18.32]What are you waiting for?
[03:22.40]
