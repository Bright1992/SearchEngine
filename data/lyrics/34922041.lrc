[00:11.27]I was born in a thunderstorm
[00:15.75]I grew up overnight
[00:20.47]I played alone, I'm playing on my own
[00:24.40]I survived
[00:28.78]Hey, I wanted everything I never had
[00:34.79]Like the love that comes with life
[00:39.60]I wore envy and I hated it
[00:43.77]But I survived
[00:48.54]I had wanted to go to a place where all the demons go
[00:53.13]Where the wind don't change
[00:54.72]And nothing in the ground can ever grow
[00:58.15]No hope, just lies, and you're taught to cry in your pillow
[01:02.61]But I'll survive
[01:07.35]I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
[01:12.07]I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
[01:16.87]I'm alive, I'm alive
[01:26.45]I'm alive, I'm alive
[01:37.30]I found solace in the strangest place
[01:41.94]Way in the back of my mind
[01:46.66]I saw my life in a stranger's face
[01:51.53]And it was mine
[01:55.63]I had wanted to go to a place where all the demons go
[02:00.42]Where the wind don't change
[02:01.90]And nothing in the ground can ever grow
[02:05.38]No hope, just lies, and you're taught to cry in your pillow
[02:09.97]But I'll survive
[02:14.46]I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
[02:19.39]I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
[02:24.10]I'm alive, I'm alive
[02:33.89]I'm alive, I'm alive
[02:44.16]You took it out, but I'm still breathing
[02:46.67]You took it out, but I'm still breathing
[02:48.99]You took it out, but I'm still breathing
[02:51.41]You took it out, but I'm still breathing
[02:53.77]You took it out, but I'm still breathing
[02:56.06]You took it out, but I'm still breathing
[02:58.56]You took it out, but I'm still breathing
[03:00.87]You took it out, but I'm still breathing
[03:03.32]I had made every single mistake
[03:05.58]That you could ever possibly make
[03:07.85]I took and I took and I took what you gave
[03:10.18]But you never noticed that I was in pain
[03:12.59]I knew what I wanted, I went in and got it
[03:15.00]Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
[03:17.43]I told you that I would never be forgotten
[03:19.85]I know that's part of you
[03:26.63]And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
[03:31.27]I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
[03:36.28]I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
[03:39.34](You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
[03:40.99]I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
[03:44.11](You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
[03:45.94]I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
[03:48.93](You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
[03:50.75]I'm alive
[03:55.31]I'm alive, I'm alive
[04:04.99]I'm alive, I'm alive
