[00:33.71]Look at what you've done
[00:37.87]Stand still, falling away from me
[00:42.02]When it takes so long
[00:45.87]For I desire, what do you want to be?
[00:50.21]I'm holding on
[00:54.31]Yourself was never enough for me
[00:58.67]Gotta be so strong
[01:01.62]There's a power in what you do
[01:04.18]Now every other day I've been watching you
[01:06.28]I'll show you what it feels like
[01:12.68]Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
[01:19.01]We did everything right
[01:21.17]Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
[01:27.27]I'll show you what it feels like
[01:29.42]Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
[01:35.62]We did everything right
[01:37.77]Now I'm on the outside
[02:13.83]So you give me no reason
[02:17.10]For me to stay close to you
[02:19.45]Tell me what lovers do
[02:22.00]How are we still breathing
[02:25.60]It's never for us to choose
[02:27.90]I'll be the strength in you
[02:30.46]Now I'm holding on
[02:34.60]Yourself was never enough for me
[02:38.66]Gotta be so strong
[02:41.72]There's a power in what you do
[02:44.32]Now every other day I've been watching you
[02:50.52]I'll show you what it feels like
[02:52.81]Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
[02:58.87]We did everything right
[03:01.12]Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
[03:07.18]I'll show you what it feels like
[03:09.38]Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
[03:15.58]We did everything right
[03:17.79]Now I'm on the outside
[03:40.49]I'll show you what it feels like
[03:43.15]Now I'm on the outside
[03:49.11]I'll show you what it feels like
[03:57.39]I'll show you what it feels like
[03:59.80]Now I'm on the outside
[04:05.99]We did everything right
[04:08.05]Now I'm on the outside
