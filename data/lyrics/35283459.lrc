[00:05.34]Guess it's true
[00:05.84]I'm not good
[00:06.55]At a one night stand
[00:09.99]But I still need love
[00:11.21]Cos I'm just a man
[00:14.64]These nights never seem to go to plan
[00:19.59]I don't want you to leave
[00:20.82]Will you hold my hand
[02:37.29][02:18.35][01:39.99][00:23.35]Oh won't you
[02:38.67][02:19.66][01:41.30][00:24.66]Stay with me
[02:42.41][02:23.14][01:44.94][00:28.18]Cos you're
[02:43.52][02:24.56][01:46.26][00:29.59]All I need
[02:47.01][02:27.94][01:49.74][00:33.11]This ain't love
[01:51.41][02:48.57][02:29.56][00:34.78]It's clear to see
[02:51.97][02:32.45][01:54.15][00:37.61]But darling
[02:53.34][02:33.76][01:55.52][00:38.88]Stay with me
[01:22.90]Why am I so emotional?
[01:26.81]No it's not a good look
[01:28.11]Gain some self control
[01:31.50]Deep down I know this never works
[01:36.30]But you can lay with me
[01:37.60]So it doesn't hurt
