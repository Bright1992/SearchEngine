[00:00.80]
[00:13.56]When tomorrow comes
[00:15.30]I'll be on my own
[00:16.92]Feeling frightened up
[00:18.34]The things that I don't know
[00:20.22]When tomorrow comes

[00:33.14]And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along
[00:40.00]I got all I need when I got you and I
[00:43.05]I look around me, and see sweet life
[00:46.33]I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
[00:49.43]You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
