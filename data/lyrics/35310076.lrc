[00:05.22]It's the strangest feeling
[00:08.24]Feeling this way for you
[00:10.11]There's something in the way you move
[00:12.38]Something in the way you move
[00:14.15]With you I'm never healing
[00:16.80]It's heartache filled with you
[00:18.81]There's something in the way you move
[00:21.34]I don't know what it is you do
[00:23.33]Now I'm knowing your body ain't good enough for me
[00:27.46]But this heart is open, bloodstains on my sleeve
[00:31.87]When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
[00:35.97]But tonight I meet yours again
[00:40.55]But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
[00:44.34]Playing with fire,
[00:46.24]I was the first to fall
[00:49.32]Heart is sinking like a cannonball
[00:53.17]Baby, kill me, what you waiting for?
[00:58.16]Something in the way you move
[01:00.66]It's something in the way you do it
[01:02.85]Something in the way you move
[01:04.86]Oh
[01:07.09]Something in the way you move
[01:09.29]It's something in the way you do it
[01:11.70]Something in the way you move
[01:13.61]Oh
[01:15.88]Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[01:18.64]Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[01:20.59]There's an evil night,
[01:22.86]The stars don't shine tonight, no
[01:24.88]It's something in the way you do
[01:27.26]It's something in the way you
[01:29.00]You bring me closer, farther
[01:31.78]Bring me just enough
[01:33.98]The lies always seem so true
[01:36.13]There's nothing left for me to lose
[01:38.25]There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
[01:42.12]But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
[01:46.48]When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
[01:50.85]And tonight they meet yours again
[01:55.15]But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
[01:59.14]Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
[02:03.98]Heart is sinking like a cannonball
[02:08.09]Baby, kill me, what you waiting for?
[02:13.47]Something in the way you move

[02:22.27]Something in the way you move
[02:24.13]It's something in the way you do it
[02:26.40]Something in the way you move
[02:28.29]Oh
[02:31.22]Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:33.40]Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:40.61]Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:42.48]Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:48.45]But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
[02:52.25]Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
[02:56.89]Heart is sinking like a cannonball
[03:01.69]Baby, kill me, what you waiting for?
[03:06.52]Something in the way you move
[03:08.38]It's something in the way you do it
[03:10.76]Something in the way you move
[03:12.63]Oh
[03:15.24]Something in the way you move
[03:17.21]It's something in the way you do it
