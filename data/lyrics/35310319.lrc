[00:01.66][Verse 1: Chris Brown]
[00:09.44]She’s just perfect in every kinda way
[00:18.36]But I don’t think I can handle her pain
[00:23.69]So messed up and I’m too busy just running my game
[00:29.32]Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake
[00:33.97]
[00:36.06][Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
[00:35.52]I’ve tried to change but they always around, pulling me down in bed
[00:40.90]Gave you my word but they were just broken promises
[00:46.55]Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex
[00:53.28]I feel like shit, you know I ain’t shit
[00:55.82]
[00:56.43][Chorus: Chris Brown]
[00:57.77]Sorry, won’t turn back the clock
[01:02.77]Baby I took advantage cause I knew you
[01:06.30]Wouldn’t believe it, so I used you

[01:21.11]We at the crib, she got her legs wrapped around my waist
[01:23.71]Conversation, she lick every tattoo that’s on my face
[01:26.61]Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that’s every day
[01:29.50]Temporary separations, confessing my mistakes
[01:32.24]She packed her bags and left me home and I’m still hurt
[01:35.65]You new pussy, but she can’t tell me that it’s real first
[01:38.49]A lot of lies apologized, the thirst real
[01:41.43]When she hit this thinking to herself, “Damn this verse real”
[01:44.18]Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
[01:47.22]Send the bottles to her table then made love on the jet
[01:49.91]Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
