[00:01.09][Verse 1: Eminem]
[00:02.28]Said you want a little company
[00:10.27]And I love it cause the thrill’s cheap
[00:12.62]Said you left him for good this time
[00:14.74]Still if he knew I was here, you’d wanna kill me
[00:17.04]But it’s time you met the real me, filthy
[00:19.77]But wasn’t always, will be
[00:21.03]Your pill refill, feeling I’ll still be
[00:22.92]Your addiction, you can touch a prescription, but don’t fill me
[00:25.49]I let you see my dark side, but like a mic check, you got one too
[00:29.79]So when the sparks fly, we hit the flight deck and got sprung, pew
[00:34.24]Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
[00:35.97]But tonight we don't need those pills, just the effects of each other
[00:38.42]But we gon' film cause I will want your ex to see
[00:41.48](Get it?) that...
[00:42.63][Chorus: The Weeknd]
[00:43.37]I only call you when it's half past five
[00:47.07]The only time that I'll be by your side
[00:51.44]I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
[00:54.81]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
[00:56.88]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
[00:59.60]I only fuck you when it's half past five
[01:04.31]The only time I'd ever call you mine
[01:08.10]I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
[01:11.48]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
[01:13.81]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
[01:17.30][Verse 2: Eminem]
[01:17.80]And every time he hurt you, I heard you
[01:20.29]Your shoulder to cry on
[01:22.14]And I’ll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
[01:24.68]You said he drove you to my arms
[01:26.33]But don’t you know, remember when I told you
[01:29.08]I would never let down my guard
[01:31.45]And I hold you, feel like dirt when I hold you
[01:33.71]Cause is it really over?
[01:35.45]But you want a little company
[01:37.38]And you just really wanna thrill seek
[01:39.83]Said you left him for good this time
[01:41.74]Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
[01:44.08]Or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
[01:46.99]But these hills see, from that POV
[01:49.20]We can touch but the only way you’ll film me
[01:52.47]Is with a camera, feel me?
[01:53.15]You’re nothing but a barfly
[01:54.52]You got your sights set on the one who you run to
[01:57.70]But I’m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
[02:01.42]So keep texting me, but at night, if you seek those thrills
[02:05.16]What I expect to be?
[02:05.67]Cause if you cheat on him just means I will be the next to be
[02:07.91]Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
[02:11.32]And don’t lecture me, just accept that...
[02:13.92][Chorus: The Weeknd]
[02:14.64]I only call you when it's half past five
[02:18.28]The only time that I'll be by your side
[02:22.72]I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
[02:26.21]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
[02:28.20]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
[02:31.06]I only fuck you when it's half past five
[02:35.38]The only time I'd ever call you mine
[02:39.47]I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
[02:43.09]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
[02:45.46]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
[02:48.92][Bridge: The Weeknd]
[02:49.52]Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
[02:57.64]Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
[03:07.66]Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
[03:14.82]Only you to trust, only you
[03:19.89]
[03:22.10][Chorus: The Weeknd]
[03:22.89]I only call you when it's half past five
[03:26.24]The only time that I'll be by your side
[03:30.65]I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
[03:34.12]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
[03:36.18]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
[03:38.88]I only fuck you when it's half past five
[03:43.23]The only time I'd ever call you mine
[03:47.34]I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
[03:51.07]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
[03:53.26]When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
[03:56.65][Outro: The Weeknd]

[04:00.38]Yene konjo, ewedihalehu
[04:04.38]Yene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir
[04:08.82]Yene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir
