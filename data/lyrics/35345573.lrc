[00:00.67]Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
[00:04.37]And every night has its day, so magical
[00:08.34]And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
[00:12.38]That can't be defeated
[00:15.91]For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
[00:19.62]In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
[00:23.41]For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
[00:27.51]With something to believe in
[00:31.86]Monday left me broken
[00:34.72]Tuesday I was through with hoping
[00:38.42]Wednesday my empty arms were open
[00:42.52]Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
[00:47.13]Thank the stars it's Friday
[00:50.01]I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
[00:53.75]Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
[00:57.80]I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
[01:02.67]To come around
[01:13.69]I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
[01:18.46]To come around
[01:48.89]We are one of a kind irreplaceableâ€œ
[01:52.47]How did I get so blind and so cynical
[01:56.48]If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
[02:00.29]No we can't be defeated
[02:04.69]Monday left me broken
[02:07.49]Tuesday I was through with hoping
[02:11.32]Wednesday my empty arms were open
[02:15.06]Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
[02:20.04]Thank the stars it's Friday
[02:22.74]I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
[02:26.45]Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
[02:30.52]I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
[02:35.93]To come around
[02:46.11]I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
[02:50.79]To come around
[03:33.17]I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
