[00:06.750]The light of the morning finds you sleeping in my bed
[00:14.370]And it's not like the stories, it's never like what they said
[00:22.370]I know who you want me to be, but I'm just not there yet
[00:30.140]Yeah, the broken road's always been home and it's so hard to forget
[00:37.740]Wait for me now
[00:40.930]Will you wait for me now?
[00:46.420]I might think too much, drink too much, stay out too late
[00:50.290]I know I'm just a fool, but I swear I can change
[00:54.400]I can't steal you the stars
[00:56.020]But I can give you this second hand heart
[01:02.440]All your friends think I'm hopeless, they don't understand
[01:06.620]That this imperfect love can start over again
[01:10.430]It's been broken apart
[01:12.080]Will you still take my second hand heart?
[01:18.200]Yeah, the light of the morning finds you sleeping in my bed
[01:26.420]And it's not like the stories, it's never like what they said

[02:10.760]That this imperfect love can start over again
[02:14.040]It's been broken apart
[02:16.370]Will you still take my second hand heart?
[02:22.600]If you let me show you, I could love you the same
[02:26.070]And I can't steal you the stars, but I can try every day
[02:29.900]Oh, you know they'll never tear us apart
[02:39.030]And I'm just a fool, but I swear I can change
[02:42.700]I can't steal you the stars, but I can try every day
[02:46.260]And you know, you've got my second hand heart
[02:54.580]You might think too much, drink too much, stay out too late
