[00:00.57]Didn't I warn you not to
[00:05.38]Didn't I warn you good
[00:10.34]Maybe we couldn't help it
[00:15.21]Maybe we never should
[00:29.46]Didn't I say it slowly?
[00:34.47]Didn't I make it clear?
[00:39.27]Is it unfair to ask you?
[00:43.90]Why it is you're still here?
[00:48.58]You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, singing
[00:53.15]Come back home and it don't feel the same
[00:56.99]Well I've bled words onto a page for you
[01:02.11]And you never knew my name
[02:05.08]Didn't I make it harder?
[02:10.03]Didn't I leave you that?
[02:15.20]Was it too much to ask you?
[02:19.94]Why it is you still care?
[02:24.44]You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, singing
[02:29.33]Come back home and it don't feel the same
[02:33.41]Well I've bled words onto a page for you
[02:38.10]And you never knew my name
[03:40.71]You never knew my name
