[00:19.20]I eat my dinner in my bathtub
[00:24.00]Then I go to sex clubs
[00:26.30]Watching freaky people getting it on
[00:30.50]It doesn't make me nervous

[01:35.30]I pick up daddies at the playground
[01:38.20]How I spent my daytime
[01:40.80]Losing up the frown
[01:42.80]Make them feel alive
[01:45.30]Or make it fast and greasy
