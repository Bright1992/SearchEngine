[00:13.67]Running round
[00:16.27]
[00:17.12]Chasing hearts
[00:20.57]Chasing bodies
[00:23.94]To fix the past
[00:27.55]I don't know how I reached this place
[00:34.60]So far from heaven so far from grace
[00:41.75]And I run to give in to the pressure
[00:45.07]'Cause I feel like the city's got the better of me
[00:48.93]Oh this casual love
[00:51.38]
[00:52.00]Isn't what it seems
[00:55.52]
[00:56.03]And I try to imagine something closer
[00:59.95]And somebody who is good for me
[01:03.09]I'm so tired of all this searching
[01:06.80]
[01:07.35]Do I do I do I do I go home to nothing
[01:13.85]
[01:14.40]Or stay out for more
[01:17.01]
[01:17.89]Give in to someone
[01:20.82]
[01:21.33]Or knock down my door
[01:24.46]Or drown all my shadows
[01:27.82]
[01:28.56]Drown them like before
[01:33.12]Drowning shadows once more
[01:42.31]
[01:45.27]The more I drink
[01:47.83]
[01:48.68]The more I drown
[01:51.13]
[01:52.19]I found that thinking
[01:54.67]
[01:55.74]I wrote it down
[01:58.59]
[01:59.25]The more I rise above it all
[02:05.24]
[02:06.27]The less I care about those falls
[02:13.51]And I run to give in to the pressure
[02:16.75]'Cause I feel like the city's got the better of me
[02:20.81]Oh this casual love
[02:22.86]
[02:23.75]Isn't what it seems
[02:27.75]And I try to imagine something closer
[02:31.65]And somebody who is good for me
[02:34.82]I'm so tired of all this searching
[02:38.37]
[02:39.10]Do I do I do I do I go home to nothing
[02:45.51]
[02:46.10]Or stay out for more
[02:48.76]
[02:49.63]Give in to someone
[02:52.98]Or knock down my door
[02:56.16]Or drown all my shadows
[02:59.59]
[03:00.28]Drown them like before
[03:04.84]Drowning shadows once more
[03:14.07]
[03:16.94]Once more
[03:22.21]
[03:23.96]Once more
[03:29.73]
[03:32.36]Go home to nothing or stay out for more
[03:38.25]
[03:39.07]Give in to someone or lock down my door
[03:45.90]Or drown all my shadows
[03:49.01]
[03:49.72]Drown them like before
[03:54.29]Drowning shadows once more
