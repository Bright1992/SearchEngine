[00:02.380]
[00:03.720]
[00:05.980]Yeah
[00:06.420]A new disease in my town called Idiotic
[00:08.660]Every pretty lady in my city got it,
[00:11.020]point blank
[00:11.980]Periodically empty seats,
[00:13.170]dine at Ciprianis
[00:14.270]Like Beyonc√©, they're getting by
[00:16.250]or they get embodied
[00:17.640]So Sasha Fierce,
[00:19.160]a whole lot of tears
[00:20.720]Rolling down her cheeks,
[00:22.120]crying till she's sound asleep
[00:23.620]Preach, pray
[00:25.440]that today is not a lonely one
[00:27.300]You gotta know
[00:28.000]you not the only one
[00:30.580]You and me we made a vow
[00:36.300]For better or for worse
[00:41.960]I can't believe you let me down
[00:46.230]But the proof is in the way it hurts
[00:53.850]For months on end
[00:55.370]I've had my doubts
[00:59.720]Denying every tear
[01:07.850]I wish this would be over now
[01:11.860]But I know that I still need you here
[01:17.620]You say I'm crazy
[01:23.920]Cause you don't think
[01:25.370]I know what you've done
[01:29.380]But when you call me baby
[01:35.570]I know I'm not the only one
[01:42.850]You've been so unavailable
[01:48.650]Now sadly I know why
[01:54.580]Your heart is unobtainable
[01:58.620]Even though Lord knows you kept mine
[02:04.540]You say I'm crazy
[02:10.800]Cause you don't think
[02:12.230]I know what you've done
[02:16.210]But when you call me baby
[02:22.520]I know I'm not the only one
[02:28.870]We all guilty of the same crime
[02:30.980]If you ask me,
[02:32.120]I might've had a couple women
[02:33.530]at the same time
[02:34.630]But you handle the pressure,
[02:35.870]Jack Daniels for breakfast
[02:37.420]A cap of valium mixed
[02:38.590]with antidepressants, precious
[02:41.040]My momma said that we need love
[02:42.960]Till I found out life's a bitch
[02:44.440]with no prenup, you're on your own
[02:46.440]Divorces or court splits,
[02:47.520]decisions and choices
[02:49.010]The Porsche or the fortress?
[02:50.480]Ignore it or forefeit
[02:51.600]You say I'm crazy
[03:02.330]Cause you don't think
[03:03.600]I know what you've done
[03:07.810]But when you call me baby
[03:14.070]I know I'm not the only one
[03:20.070]I know I'm not the only one
[03:25.740]I know I'm not the only one
[03:31.400]I know
[03:37.720]I'm not the only one
