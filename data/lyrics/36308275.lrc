[00:13.74]Oh baby, oh baby
[00:15.29]Oh we both know the truth
[00:18.99]If it were the real me and you,
[00:22.09]This wouldn't be the right thing to do
[00:26.72]Now the room is so hazy
[00:28.82]We're too lost in the fumes
[00:31.96]I feel like it's just me and you,
[00:35.18]Yeah we got nothing to lose
[00:39.69]It's too late to run away from it all
[00:42.85]It's too late to get away from it all
[00:46.18]I'm done with running so I give in to you
[00:52.30]This moment has caused a reaction
[00:58.79]Resulting in our reattachment
[01:05.41]Oh you take me to nirvana
[01:11.94]I don't think this will last
[01:14.82]But you're here in my arms
[01:19.02]Oh baby, oh baby
[01:20.61]Oh, we both feel the same
[01:24.30]I'm not gonna give you my name
[01:27.36]And I don't think you want that to change
[01:31.83]We're in this together
[01:34.34]We don't know who we are
[01:37.30]Even if it's moving too fast,
[01:40.52]Baby we should take it too far
[01:45.01]It's too late to run away from it all
[01:48.13]It's too late to get away from it all
[01:51.56]I'm done with running so I give in to you
[01:57.58]This moment has caused a reaction
[02:04.10]Resulting in our reattachment
[02:10.60]Oh you take me to nirvana
[02:17.21]I don't think this will last
[02:20.11]But you're here in my arms
[02:24.55]
[02:49.68]Oh you take me to nirvana
[02:56.21]I don't think this will last
[02:59.34]But you're here in my arms
