[00:19.51]I'm feeling something something different
[00:24.26]When you left my picture changed
[00:29.30]I was blinded I'd not envisioned
[00:34.07]The same face in a different frame
[00:38.46]
[00:40.04]It's an omen caught my baby crying
[00:45.75]Saw the silver lining
[00:49.12]It must be an omen
[00:52.85]Needed you to show me without you I am lonely
[00:58.15]My mind would rule my heart
[01:02.07]I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
[01:06.35]
[01:07.55]It left me torn apart
[01:11.53]But now I see your tears as an omen
[01:15.81]
[01:16.63]Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
[01:18.88]Oh-Oh-Oh

[01:36.38]You were waiting I was vacant
[01:40.73]
[01:41.28]You left before my eyes
[01:46.10]Then it hit me you're relocating
[01:50.61]And I need you by my side
[01:55.46]
[01:56.53]It's an omen caught my baby crying
[02:02.18]Saw the silver lining
[02:05.60]It must be an omen
[02:09.33]Needed you to show me without you I am lonely
[02:15.32]
[02:16.86]My mind would rule my heart
[02:20.90]I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
[02:25.17]
[02:26.42]It left me torn apart
[02:30.30]But now I see your tears as an omen
[02:34.64]
[02:35.32]Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
[02:37.88]Oh-Oh-Oh
[02:39.67]Omen
