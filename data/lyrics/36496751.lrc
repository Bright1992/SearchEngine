[00:23.00]You are to me
[00:25.76]A part of me just like anatomy
[00:30.48]You're pulling me
[00:33.24]You're pulling me in like you're gravity
[00:38.21]I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
[00:41.24]Instead of hollow
[00:45.72]Sugar on your lips it's hard to kill
[00:47.76]Jagged like a pill so hard to swallow
[00:52.24]Am I in love with you am I in love with you
[00:56.09]Or am I in love with the feeling
[00:59.69]Trying to find the truth trying to find the truth
[01:03.72]But sometimes the heart is deceiving
[01:07.36]Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
[01:11.94]If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
[01:15.55]In love with you am I in love with you
[01:18.50]Or am I in love with the feeling
[01:31.07]You give to me
[01:33.62]Everything anything that I could dream
[01:38.04]And at least that's what it seems
[01:41.34]Could it be I don't know what's good for me
[01:46.28]I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
[01:49.27]Instead of hollow
[01:53.75]Sugar on your lips it's hard to kill
[01:56.10]Jagged like a pill so hard to swallow
[02:00.30]Am I in love with you am I in love with you
[02:03.94]Or am I in love with the feeling
[02:07.68]Trying to find the truth trying to find the truth
[02:11.61]But sometimes the heart is deceiving
[02:16.29]Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
[02:19.97]If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
[02:23.57]In love with you am I in love with you
[02:26.56]Or am I in love with the feeling
[02:39.26]I'm sinking faster and faster
[02:43.00]Between heaven and disaster
[02:46.62]Sorry if I made you feel like
[02:49.75]I'm standing on the borderline
[03:00.97]Am I in love with you am I in love with you
[03:04.34]Or am I in love with the feeling
[03:08.24]Trying to find the truth trying to find the truth
[03:11.98]But sometimes the heart is deceiving
[03:16.80]Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
[03:20.54]If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
[03:23.98]In love with you
[03:27.02]Or am I in love with the feeling
