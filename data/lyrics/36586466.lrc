[00:13.300]Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
[00:20.300]Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
[00:28.300]Looking out all the tears I've wiped
[00:35.300]Looking all the promises that I've kept
[00:42.300]I put my heart into your hands
[00:47.300]It's my soul to keep
[00:50.300]I let you in with all that I can
[00:54.300]You are not hard to reach
[00:57.300]And you've blessed me with the best gift that I've ever known
[01:05.300]You give me purpose
[01:11.300]Yeah,you've given me purpose
[01:19.300]Thinking my journeys come to one end
[01:24.300]Oh~ Singing out a farewell to my friends
[01:32.300]for inner peace
[01:34.300]Ask you to forgive me for my sins
[01:38.300]Ho~Would you please
[01:41.300]I'm more than grateful for that time we spent
[01:46.300]My spirit is at ease
[01:49.300]I put my heart into your hands
[01:52.300]Learn a lesson that you teach
[01:55.300]No matter when.Wherever I am
[02:00.300]You're not hard to reach
[02:04.300]And you've given me the best gift that I've ever known
[02:10.300]You give me purpose
[02:16.300]everyday.You give me purpose
[02:23.300]in every way
[02:26.300]Ho~ You are my everything
[02:33.300]Ho~ You are my everything
[02:39.300]I don't know if this is wrong,because someone else tell me that it is wrong.
[02:43.300]But I feel this.So,
[02:45.300]let me,just like,try my best not to let this happen again.
[02:48.300]We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.
[02:53.300]You can't be hard on yourself,for this was the card you've really given.
[02:56.300]So you have to understand these like
[02:58.300]that's not who you are.
[02:59.300]You know you are trying to be the best you can be.
[03:01.300]But that's all you can do.
[03:03.300]If you don't give it all,you got the only choose yourself.
[03:06.300]Give it all you've got.
[03:07.300]But if it ends up happening,It ends up happening.
[03:09.300]That's what happening with me.It's like,
[03:12.300]God,I've given all I've got.
[03:13.300]Sometimes,I'm weak and I'm gonna do it.
[03:15.300]And,it's like,I'm not given myself grace.
[03:17.300]I'm,just like,understand that's how it is.
