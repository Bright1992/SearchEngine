[00:14.19]Ended up on a crossroad
[00:17.23]Try to figure out which way to go
[00:20.23]It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
[00:22.45]Running in the same place
[00:26.55]You got your hazard lights on now
[00:29.49]Hoping that somebody would slow down
[00:32.72]Praying for a miracle
[00:35.00]Who'll show you grace
[00:37.68]Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
[00:41.31]With a long journey ahead
[00:43.80]Seen a truck pull over
[00:46.29]God sent an angel to help you out
[00:50.08]He gave you direction
[00:52.06]Showed you how to read a map
[00:53.83]With a long journey ahead
[00:56.38]Said it ain't never over
[00:58.92]Oh even in the midst of doubt
[01:01.80]Life is worth living
[01:08.15]Life is worth living so live another day
[01:14.34]The meaning of forgiveness
[01:17.64]People make mistakes doesn't mean you have to give in
[01:23.08]Life is worth living again
[01:29.92]Relationship on a ski slope
[01:32.97]Avalanche comin' down slow
[01:36.30]Do we have enough time to salvage this love
[01:42.36]Feels like a blizzard in April
[01:45.62]Cause my heart is just that cold
[01:49.03]Skating on thin ice
[01:50.81]But it's strong enough to hold us up
[01:53.22]Seen her scream and holler
[01:55.16]Put us both on blast
[01:57.31]Tearing each other down
[01:59.58]When I thought it was over
[02:02.11]God sent us an angel to help us out yeah
[02:06.02]He gave us direction showed us how to make it last
[02:09.77]For that long journey ahead
[02:12.28]Said it ain't ever over
[02:14.69]Oh even in the midst of doubt
[02:17.79]Life is worth living
[02:23.81]Life is worth living so live another day
[02:30.17]The meaning of forgiveness

[02:52.02]What I'd give for my affection
[02:55.10]Is a different perception
[02:58.61]From what the world may see
[03:01.48]They try to crucify me
[03:04.82]I ain't perfect won't deny
[03:07.60]My reputation's on the line
[03:11.14]So I'm working on a better me
[03:14.82]Life is worth living oh yeah
[03:20.89]Life is worth living so live another day

[03:30.19]People make mistakes
[03:31.94]Only god can judge me
[03:37.38]Life is worth living again
[03:41.69]Another day
[03:43.76]Life is worth living again
