[00:20.93]I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
[00:27.61]See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can’t deny it

[02:17.99]To keep you warm
[02:20.77]I showed you the game everybody else was playing, that's for sure

[02:56.75]I need you, (the the the the the)
[02:59.47]I need you the most
