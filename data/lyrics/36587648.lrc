[00:01.82]Been You - Justin Bieber
[00:08.46]Feeling the remnants gone in an instant
[00:11.90]Blink of an eye no goodbye
[00:16.17]I had a notion deep as the ocean
[00:20.28]Blue like the sky oh my
[00:24.98]Like a permanent stain
[00:27.31]wishing I could just wash away away
[00:33.80]Prayed our love wasn't vain
[00:35.99]Who was to blame for all the pain for all the pain
[00:41.58]If I would've known if I would've known
[00:44.63]If I would have known it could have been you
[00:50.71]If I had the chance
[00:52.92]if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
[00:58.81]I never wanted to be wanted to be your remnants
[01:05.75]No but if I if I would've known
[01:09.84]If I would have known it could have been you
[01:14.21]been you been you
[01:16.34]There are percussion's I'm missing your loving
[01:19.77]Must be the night the ghost of a life
[01:24.72]All of the memories
[01:26.88]A serenity dwindling my mind
[01:31.17]All the time
[01:33.29]Like a permanent stain
[01:35.24]wishing I could just wash away away
[01:41.80]Prayed our love wasn't vain
[01:43.74]Who was to blame for all the pain for all the pain
[01:49.51]If I would've known if I would've known
[01:52.59]If I would have known it could have been you
[01:59.72]If I had the chance
[02:01.17]if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
[02:06.69]I never wanted to be wanted to be your remnants
[02:14.83]No but if I if I would've known
[02:18.13]If I would have known it could have been you
[02:21.10]been you been you
[02:40.50]If I would've known if I would've known
[02:43.53]If I would have known it could have been you
[02:49.45]If I had the chance
[02:52.00]if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
[02:57.74]I never wanted to be wanted to be your remnants
[03:05.90]No but if I if I would've known
[03:09.28]If I would have known it could have been you been you
