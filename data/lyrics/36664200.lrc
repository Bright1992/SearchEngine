[00:00.00]And now I know my heart is a ghost town
[00:09.13]My heart is a ghost town...
[00:40.31]My heart
[01:11.28]My heart is a ghost town
[01:15.75]Died last night in the dreams
[01:18.73]All the machines had been disconnected
[01:23.64]Time was thrown at the wind
[01:26.18]And all of my friends had been disaffected
[01:31.33]Now I'm searching for trust in the city of rust
[01:36.06]A city of vampires
[01:38.77]Tonight Elvis is dead
[01:41.65]And everyone's spread
[01:43.68]And love is a satire
[01:46.57]Now I know my heart is a ghost town
[01:55.60]My heart is a ghost town...
