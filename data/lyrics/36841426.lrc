[00:00.00] 作词 : Adele/Greg Kurstin
[00:10.360]If you're not the one for me
[00:15.080]Then how come I can bring you to your knees
[00:20.520]If you're not the one for me
[00:24.880]Why do I hate the idea of being free
[00:30.420]And if I'm not the one for you
[00:35.010]You've got to stop holding me the way you do
[00:39.960]Oh honey if I'm not the one for you
[00:45.040]Why have we been through what we have been through
[00:48.400]
[00:50.230]It's so cold out here in your wilderness
[01:00.220]I want you to be my keeper
[01:05.860]But not if you are so reckless
[01:08.530]
[01:10.550]If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[01:13.760]Don't pretend that you don't want me
[01:16.300]Our love ain't water under the bridge
[01:20.520]If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[01:23.840]Don't pretend that you don't want me
[01:26.430]Our love ain't water under the bridge
[01:31.170]Woaah, woaaah
[01:35.860]Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
[01:40.730]
[01:41.530]What are you waiting for?
[01:45.860]You never seem to make it through the door
[01:51.310]And who are you hiding from?
[01:55.750]It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
[02:01.560]Have I ever asked for much?
[02:05.770]The only thing that I want is your love
[02:08.900]
[02:11.280]If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[02:14.390]Don't pretend that you don't want me
[02:16.870]Our love ain't water under the bridge
[02:21.190]If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[02:24.480]Don't pretend that you don't want me
[02:26.960]Our love ain't water under the bridge
[02:31.660]Woaah, woaaah
[02:36.410]Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
[02:39.980]
[02:41.240]It's so cold in your wilderness
[02:51.450]I want you to be my keeper
[02:57.180]But not if you are so reckless
[03:00.670]
[03:03.090]If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[03:06.140]Don't pretend that you don't want me
[03:08.510]Our love ain't water under the bridge
[03:12.990]If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
[03:16.350]Don't pretend that you don't want me
[03:18.900]Our love ain't water under the bridge
[03:22.310]
[03:23.770]Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
[03:26.280]Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
[03:28.410]Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
[03:38.540]Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
[03:48.390]Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
