[00:00.00] 作词 : Adele/Greg Kurstin
[00:03.550]I only wanted to have fun
[00:08.510]Learning to fly, learning to run
[00:12.770]I let my heart decide the way
[00:17.300]When I was young
[00:21.520]Deep down I must have always known
[00:26.370]That this would be inevitable
[00:30.860]To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
[00:35.420]And bear my soul
[00:37.470]
[00:53.330]I know I'm not the only one
[00:58.570]Who regrets the things they've done
[01:02.450]Sometimes I just feel it's only me
[01:06.730]Who can't stand the reflection that they see
[01:11.620]I wish I could live a little more
[01:16.160]Look up to the sky, not just the floor
[01:20.740]I feel like my life is flashing by
[01:25.180]And all I can do is watch and cry
[01:29.740]I miss the air, I miss my friends
[01:34.340]I miss my mother; I miss it when
[01:39.100]Life was a party to be thrown
[01:43.330]But that was a million years ago
[01:47.650]
[01:51.990]When I walk around all of the streets
[01:57.240]Where I grew up and found my feed.
[02:01.670]They can't look me in the eye
[02:05.240]It's like they're scared of me
[02:10.200]I try to think of things to say
[02:15.580]Like a joke or a memory
[02:19.500]But they don't recognize me now
[02:23.780]In the light of day
[02:26.130]
[02:41.990]I know I'm not the only one
[02:47.290]Who regrets the things they've done
[02:51.170]Sometimes I just feel it's only me
[02:55.340]Never became who they thought they'd be
[03:00.330]I wish I could live a little more
[03:04.730]Look up to the sky, not just the floor
[03:09.390]I feel like my life is flashing by
[03:13.870]And all I can do is watch and cry
[03:18.500]I miss the air, I miss my friends
[03:23.200]I miss my mother, I miss it when
[03:27.600]Life was a party to be thrown
[03:31.980]But that was a million years ago
[03:37.640]A million years ago
