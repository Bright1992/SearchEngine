[00:00.00] 作词 : Adele/Paul Epworth
[00:27.950]With your loving, there ain't nothing
[00:30.400]That I can't adore
[00:32.800]The way I'm running, with you, honey
[00:34.680]Means we can break every law
[00:36.980]I find it funny that you're the only
[00:39.250]One I never looked for
[00:41.720]There is something in your loving
[00:44.150]That tears down my walls
[00:45.800]
[00:46.240]I weren't ready then; I'm ready now
[00:48.870]I'm heading straight for you
[00:51.150]You will only be eternally
[00:52.800]The one that I belong to
[00:55.660]The sweetest devotion
[01:00.580]Hitting me like an explosion
[01:05.000]All of my life, I've been frozen
[01:09.760]The sweetest devotion I know
[01:15.560]
[01:37.280]I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
[01:41.880]I'd go under and all over for your clarity
[01:46.460]When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
[01:51.010]Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone
[01:54.410]
[01:55.390]I weren't ready then; I'm ready now
[01:58.060]I'm heading straight for you
[02:00.150]You will only be eternally
[02:02.690]The one that I belong to
[02:04.030]
[02:04.990]The sweetest devotion
[02:09.720]Hitting me like an explosion
[02:14.340]All of my life, I've been frozen
[02:18.790]The sweetest devotion I've known
[02:24.190]
[02:37.120]I've been looking for you, baby
[02:39.780]In every face that I've ever known
[02:46.080]And there is something 'bout the way you love me
[02:49.840]That finally feels like home
[02:55.240]You're my light, you're my darkness
[03:00.180]You're the right kind of madness
[03:04.840]You're my hope, you're my despair
[03:09.360]You're my scope of everything everywhere
[03:13.310]
[03:14.180]The sweetest devotion
[03:19.060]Hitting me like an explosion
[03:23.580]All of my life, I've been frozen
[03:28.020]The sweetest devotion I've known
[03:42.220]Sweetest
[03:43.930]It's the sweetest
[03:46.800]Sweetest
[03:48.290]It's the sweetest
[03:51.350]Sweetest
[03:52.900]It's the sweetest
[03:55.930]Sweetest
[03:57.470]It's the sweetest
[03:59.570]Devotion
