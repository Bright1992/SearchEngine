[00:11.000]And all I remember is your back
[00:16.000]Walking towards the airport leaving us all in your past
[00:25.190]I traveled 1500 miles to see you
[00:33.170]Begged you to want me
[00:39.550]But you didn't want to
[00:42.340]But piece by piece you collected me
[00:49.500]Up off the ground but you abandoned things
[00:53.770]And piece by piece you filled the holes that you burned in me
[01:00.210]At six years old and no
[01:03.050]He never walks away
[01:04.780]He never asks for money
[01:07.200]He takes care of me
[01:09.260]He loves me
[01:11.210]Piece by piece
[01:12.960]He restored my faith
[01:15.160]That a man can be kind
[01:17.500]And a father could stay
[01:27.670]And all of your words fall flat
[01:36.000]I made something of myself and now you wanna come back
[01:45.340]But your love isn't free
[01:49.000]It has to be earned
[01:54.200]Back then I didn't have anything you needed
[01:58.500]So I was worthless
[02:03.000]But piece by piece you collected me
[02:07.660]Up off the ground but you abandoned things
[02:12.000]And piece by piece you filled the holes that you burned in me
[02:18.900]At six years old and no
[02:21.580]He never walks away
[02:23.200]He never asks for money
[02:25.630]He takes care of me
[02:27.710]Cuz He loves me
[02:30.000]Piece by piece
[02:31.500]He restored my faith
[02:34.000]That a man can be kind
[02:36.000]And a father could stay
[02:48.500]Piece by piece...
[02:56.000]Piece by piece I fell far from the tree
[03:00.000]I would never leave her like you left me
[03:04.400]She will never have to wonder her worth
[03:08.500]Because unlike you I'm gonna put her first
[03:13.200]He'll never walk away
[03:15.800]He'll never break her heart
[03:18.340]He'll take care of things
[03:20.410]He'll love her
[03:22.300]Piece by piece
[03:24.000]He restored my faith
[03:26.040]That a man can be kind
[03:28.200]And a father should be great
[03:34.000]Piece by piece...
