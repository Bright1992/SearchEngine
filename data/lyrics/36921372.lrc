[00:01.20]When I wake up to your footsteps
[00:05.59]As you get up out of bed
[00:09.98]They make a sound that sounds so simple
[00:14.62]Yet dances in my head
[00:19.60]A melody so perfect
[00:23.45]That it gets me through the day
[00:27.91]And the thought of us forever
[00:32.15]Is one that won't ever go away
[00:37.91]All I need to know is
[00:41.11]Where to stop
[00:42.22]Take my hand and show me forever
[00:46.21]So never will I ever let you go
[00:55.61]So let's hold on together
[00:59.36]To this paper and this pen
[01:03.89]And we'll write down every letter
[01:08.15]To every word we've ever said
[01:13.66]All I need to know is
[01:16.92]Where to stop
[01:18.05]Take my hand and show me forever
[01:21.94]So never will I ever let you go
[01:31.27]Let's write our story
[01:35.36]And let's sing our songs
[01:39.99]Let's hang our pictures on the wall
[01:48.00]All these precious moments
[01:52.36]That we carved in stone
[01:56.81]Are only memories after all
[02:06.82]Memories after all
[02:10.88]Memories after all
[02:18.91]You gave me all
[02:23.02]But I've got to let go
[02:27.64]I've got to let go
[02:40.81]It's deep in my soul
[02:45.29]Now I've got to let go
[02:51.08]We wrote our story
[02:54.75]And we sang our songs
[02:59.80]We hung our pictures on the wall
[03:07.63]All those precious moments
[03:11.97]That we carved in stone
[03:17.17]Are only memories after all
