[00:10.720]You were the shadow to my light
[00:14.010]Did you feel us
[00:17.750]Another Star
[00:19.720]You fade away
[00:21.680]Afraid our aim is out of sight
[00:24.560]Wanna see us
[00:28.000]Alive
[00:30.890]Where are you now
[00:36.200]Where are you now
[00:41.500]Where are you now
[00:44.340]Was it all in my fantasy
[00:46.820]Where are you now
[00:49.560]Were you only imaginary
[00:53.510]Where are you now
[00:56.860]Atlantis
[00:58.820]Under the sea
[01:01.490]Under the sea
[01:04.340]Where are you now
[01:06.740]Another dream
[01:10.020]The monster's running wild inside of me
[01:14.220]I'm faded
[01:19.660]I'm faded
[01:23.440]So lost, I'm faded
[01:30.220]I'm faded ~~~
[01:34.200]So lost, I'm faded
[01:37.530]These shallow waters never met
[01:40.470]What i needed
[01:44.250]I'm letting go
[01:46.120]A deeper dive
[01:48.120]Eternal silence of the sea
[01:51.070]I'm breathing
[01:54.900]Alive.
[01:57.570]Where are you now
[02:02.890]Where are you now
[02:08.400]Under the bright but faded lights
[02:10.870]You set my heart on fire
[02:13.440]Where are you now
[02:16.130]Where are you now
[02:18.850]...
[02:30.930]Where are you now
[02:34.220]Atlantis
[02:36.250]Under the sea
[02:38.830]Under the sea
[02:41.560]Where are you now
[02:44.170]Another dream
[02:47.460]The monster's running wild inside of me
[02:51.450]I'm faded
[02:56.920]I'm faded
[03:00.900]So lost, I'm faded
[03:07.500]I'm faded ~~~
[03:11.360]So lost, I'm faded
[03:14.400]...
