[00:19.87]Once bitten and twice shy
[00:24.01]I keep my distance
[00:25.69]But you still catch my eye
[00:28.84]Tell me baby
[00:30.34]Do you recognize me
[00:33.22]It's been a year rolling
[00:35.18]It doesn't surprise me
[00:37.96]Merry Christmas
[00:39.44]I wrapped it up and sent it
[00:42.50]Merry Christmas
[00:43.91]I loved you and reminded it
[00:46.44]Now I know what a fool I've been
[00:50.02]But if you kissed me now
[00:52.34]I know you'd fool me again
[00:55.64]Last Christmas I gave you my heart
[00:59.44]But the very next day you gave it away
[01:04.16]This year to save me from tears
[01:08.63]I'll give it to someone special
[01:13.61]Last Christmas I gave you my heart
[01:17.50]But the very next day you gave it away
[01:22.29]This year to save me from tears
[01:26.93]I'll give it to someone special
[01:50.23]A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
[01:54.54]I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
[01:59.48]I get thought you were someone to rely on
[02:03.12]Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
[02:07.65]A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
[02:11.79]A man on a cover but you tore me apart
[02:17.59]Merry Christmas
[02:19.92]Merry Christmas
[02:21.10]Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again
[02:25.89]Last Christmas I gave you my heart
[02:29.93]But the very next day you gave it away
[02:34.71]This year to save me from tears
[02:39.27]I'll give it to someone special
[02:43.93]Last Christmas I gave you my heart
[02:48.29]But the very next day you gave it away
[02:52.97]This year to save me from tears
[02:57.41]I'll give it to someone special
[03:05.45]Special
[03:14.35]Special
[03:18.96]Special
[03:23.47]Special
