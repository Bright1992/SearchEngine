[00:55.45]Heaven is not so far
[00:58.93]Under the stars
[01:03.77]We'll find a love to hold our hand through the cold,
[01:10.70]We'll find an angel lying out in the snow,
[01:17.63]We'll see a light to lead us all the way home and
[01:23.81]Wherever we go, we will know
[01:31.60]Here we are, under the stars
[01:37.09]Here we are, under the stars
[01:43.97]Heaven is not so far
[01:47.50]Heaven is not so far

[01:54.34]Under the stars
[01:59.18]Let's raise a toast for all the good days to come,
[02:06.00]Let's celebrate the season, come everyone,
[02:13.08]Let's save a kiss for us when the night is done
[02:18.56]Oh my love, I'll keep you warm
[02:26.90]Here we are, under the stars
[02:33.83]Here we are, under the stars

[02:46.20]Heaven is not so far
[02:49.70]Under the stars
[02:54.94]All the lost and lonely
[02:58.19]All the lovers holding on
[03:01.82]All of us, no matter what we've done
[03:08.61]We are not alone although we're far apart
[03:15.55]We are one, under the stars
[03:22.27]Here we are, under the stars
[03:27.91]Here we are, under the stars
[03:34.74]Heaven is not so far
[03:38.28]Heaven is not so far
[03:41.71]Heaven is not so far
[03:45.16]Under the stars
