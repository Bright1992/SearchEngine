[00:13.560]When tomorrow comes
[00:15.300]I'll be on my own
[00:16.920]Feeling frightened up
[00:18.340]The things that I don't know
[00:20.220]When tomorrow comes
[00:22.040]Tomorrow comes
[00:23.560]Tomorrow comes
[00:26.400]And though the road is long
[00:28.040]I look up to the sky
[00:29.640]And in the dark I found, I stop and I won't fly
[00:33.140]And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along
[00:39.440]
[00:40.000]I got all I need when I got you and I
[00:43.050]I look around me, and see sweet life
[00:46.330]I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
[00:49.430]You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
[00:52.800]Can't stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
[00:56.170]Can't lie, it's a sweet life

[01:18.270]I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
[01:21.900]I'm not afraid when the rain won't stop
[01:25.040]Cause you light the way
[01:26.840]You light the way, you light the way
