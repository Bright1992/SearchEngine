[00:07.10]I thought that I've been hurt before
[00:11.38]
[00:12.44]But no one's ever left me quite this sore
[00:17.33]
[00:19.70]Your words cut deeper than a knife
[00:23.72]
[00:25.14]Now I need someone to bring me back to life
[00:29.87]
[00:32.38]Got a feeling that I'm going under
[00:35.82]But I know that I'll make it out alive
[00:39.46]If I quit calling you my lover
[00:42.25]Move on
[00:43.95]You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
[00:47.48]Shaking, falling onto my knees
[00:50.54]And now that I'm without your kisses
[00:54.71]I'll be needing stitches
[00:57.79]Tripping over myself
[01:00.16]Achin' begging you to come help
[01:03.31]And now that I'm without your kisses
[01:07.57]I'll be needing stitches
[01:11.28]Just like a moth drawn to a flame
[01:15.05]
[01:16.50]Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
[01:21.19]
[01:24.04]Your bitter heart cold to a touch
[01:27.60]
[01:28.86]Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
[01:32.04]I'm left seeing red on my own
[01:36.91]Got a feeling that I'm going under
[01:39.93]But I know that I'll make it out alive
[01:43.59]If I quit calling you my lover
[01:46.46]Move on
[01:47.99]You watch me bleed till I can't breathe
[01:51.55]Shaking, falling onto my knees
[01:54.63]And now that I'm without your kisses
[01:58.64]I'll be needing stitches
[02:01.91]Tripping over myself
[02:04.28]Achin' begging you to come help
[02:07.51]And now that I'm without your kisses
[02:11.49]I'll be needing stitches
[02:14.64]
[02:21.24]Needle and a thread, gotta get you out of my head
[02:24.64]Needle and a thread, gonna wind up dead
[02:27.54]Needle and a thread, gotta get you out of my head
[02:30.94]Needle and a thread, gonna wind up dead
[02:33.96]Needle and a thread, gotta get you out of my head
[02:37.26]Needle and a thread, gonna wind up dead
[02:40.40]Needle and a thread, gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head
[02:45.90]You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
[02:49.33]Shaking, falling onto my knees
[02:51.89]And now that I'm without your kisses
[02:56.60]I'll be needing stitches
[02:59.94]Tripping over myself,
[03:02.20]Achin' begging you to come help
[03:05.28]And now that I'm without your kisses
[03:09.46]I'll be needing stitches
[03:12.86]And now that I'm without your kisses
[03:15.60]I'll be needing stitches
[03:18.17]And now that I'm without your kisses
[03:22.01]I'll be needing stitches
[03:25.06]
[03:27.70]
