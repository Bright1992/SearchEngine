[00:18.17]How can I tell you
[00:20.14]
[00:20.79]That I love you I love you
[00:24.05]
[00:26.42]I long to tell you
[00:28.56]
[00:29.10]That I'm always thinking of you
[00:32.57]
[00:33.69]I'm always thinking of you
[00:36.78]
[00:37.44]But my words just blow away
[00:40.77]
[00:41.42]And I can't think of right words to say
[00:46.85]
[00:51.56]Wherever I am
[00:53.27]
[00:54.28]I'm always walking with you
[00:57.61]
[00:59.66]Whoever I am with
[01:02.33]I'm always talking to you
[01:05.82]
[01:06.92]I'm always talking to you
[01:10.09]
[01:10.80]And I'm sad that you can't hear
[01:13.94]
[01:14.70]When I look and you're not there
[01:20.36]
[01:25.00]I need to know you
[01:27.25]I need to feel my arms around you
[01:30.81]
[01:32.26]Feel my arms surround you
[01:35.08]
[01:35.93]Like a sea around a shore
[01:38.99]
[01:40.09]I pray in hope that I might find you
[01:45.67]
[01:46.35]I find you
[01:48.13]Because heart can do no more
[01:54.08]
[01:58.35]How can I tell you
[02:00.31]
[02:00.96]That I love you I love you
[02:04.51]
[02:06.62]I long to tell you
[02:08.56]
[02:09.28]That I'm always thinking of you
[02:12.68]
[02:13.66]I'm always thinking of you
[02:16.90]
[02:17.60]But my words just blow away
[02:20.92]
[02:21.49]And I can't think of right words to say
