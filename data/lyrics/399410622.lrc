[00:03.24]Broke down
[00:04.04]Thought that I would drown
[00:05.56]Hope that I've been found
[00:07.00]Before I hit the ground
[00:09.07]Some day out the corner of my eye, hey
[00:14.66]Saw you weeping
[00:15.75]Saw you creeping
[00:16.40]Saw you sneaking in the shadow's long
[00:19.09] The fear so strong
[00:20.58]Saw you out the corner of my eye
[00:25.54]Don't come for me today
[00:31.59]I'm feeling good
[00:33.00]I'mma savor it
[00:37.23]Don't come for me today
[00:42.86]I'm feeling good
[00:44.62]I remember when
[00:48.33](Reaper)
[00:49.34]You came to take me away
[00:51.84]So close I was to heaven's gates
[00:55.12]But no baby, no baby, not today
[00:59.69]Oh, you tried to track me down
[01:03.31]You followed me like the darkest cloud
[01:06.78]But no baby, no baby, not today
[01:11.24](Reaper) Oh reaper

[01:35.73]So come back when I'm good to go
[01:38.02]I got drinks to drink
[01:39.58]And men to hold
[01:41.46]I got good things to do with my life, yeah
[01:45.90]Oh, I wanna dance in the open breeze
[01:49.64]Feel the wind in my hair
[01:51.15]Hear the ocean sing
[01:53.07]I got good things to feel in my life, yeah
[01:58.25]Don't come for me today
[02:04.15]I'm feeling good
[02:05.43]I'mma savor it
