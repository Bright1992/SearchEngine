[00:13.35]This is gonna hurt but I blame myself first
[00:16.31]Cause I ignored the truth
[00:19.65]Drunk off that love, my head up
[00:22.63]There’s no forgetting you
[00:25.66]You’ve awoken me, but you’re choking me
[00:28.49]I was so obsessed
[00:32.10]Gave you all of me, and now honestly, I got nothing left
[00:37.31]I loved you dangerously
[00:43.76]More than the air that I breathe
[00:50.20]Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
[00:54.38]Didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
[01:02.50]Baby, I loved you dangerously
[01:06.20]Mmmm, mmmm
[01:09.31]I loved you dangerously
[01:17.23]Usually, I hold the power with both my hands
[01:20.98]Tied behind my back
[01:23.76]Look at how things change, cause now you’re the train
[01:26.69]And I’m tied to the track
[01:29.64]You’ve awoken me, but you’re choking me
[01:32.52]I was so obsessed
[01:35.97]Gave you all of me, and now honestly, I got nothing left
[01:41.00]Cause I loved you dangerously
[01:47.81]More than the air that I breathe

[01:58.43]Didn’t care if the explosion ruined me

[02:09.31]You took me down, down, down, down
[02:13.34]And kissed my lips quick goodbye
[02:15.55]I see it now, now, now, now
[02:19.72]It was a matter of time
[02:22.23]You know I know, there’s only one place this could lead
[02:29.22]Cause you are the fire, I’m gasoline
[02:33.40]I love you, I love you, I love you
[02:35.82]I loved you dangerously
[02:41.16]Ooh, more than the air that I breathe
[02:47.20]Oh now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
[02:52.78]Didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
[02:59.35]Oh, oh baby, I loved you dangerously
