[00:09.55]Thinking back in time when I had you to lose
[00:14.00]Those were the days baby you were the truth
[00:20.85]And nothing you could do would ever change that
[00:26.40]You riding with me, me riding for you
[00:30.57]We followed our hearts don’t forget what they do
[00:37.78]But somewhere down the line I left you hanging
[00:43.53]For you, I could climb
[00:47.73]Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
[00:51.92]Oh my friend, I’ll never break your heart again
[00:58.77]Cause I, I will always love you
[01:05.93]Baby I could never judge you
[01:10.09]I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
[01:15.87]I, I will always love you
[01:22.82]Baby I could never judge you
[01:27.04]I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
[01:35.86]You know me like inside and out, how I feel
[01:40.37]Nothing more nothing less you’re the real
[01:47.22]I wanna take this time to thank you baby
[01:52.98]For you, I could climb
[01:57.26]Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
[02:01.40]Oh my friend, I’ll never break your heart again
[02:08.14]Cause I, I will always love you
[02:15.30]Baby I could never judge you
[02:19.52]I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
[02:25.41]I, I will always love you
[02:32.18]Baby I could never judge you
[02:36.67]I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
[02:43.57]So let it be known now
[02:44.64]You’re queen to my throne now
[02:45.80]It’s you at all times
[02:47.78]I’ll never reject you
[02:48.94]I’ll love and respect you
[02:50.00]Cause you’re my lifeline
[02:52.00]Only thing on my wishlist
[02:53.14]You love and forgiveness
[02:54.05]For that I will climb
[02:56.13]Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
[03:00.55]Why would I fight it?
[03:01.50]I know that it’s right when you’re holding my hand
[03:04.56]I knew when I saw you
[03:05.68]That God was just giving me a second chance
[03:08.90]I’ll climb every mountain
[03:09.87]And scream at the top of my lungs that I’m yours
[03:13.18]You know that I’m yours
[03:15.10]Cause I, I will always love you (I will always love you)
[03:22.80]Baby I could never judge you (I could never judge you)
[03:27.00]I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
[03:32.76]I, I will always love you (Darling I will always love you)
[03:38.10]I will always love you
[03:39.59]Baby I could never judge you
[03:44.01]I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
