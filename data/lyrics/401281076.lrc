[00:15.01]I saw my problems and I'll see the light
[00:18.18]We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right
[00:23.81]There ain't no danger we can go too far
[00:27.14]We start believin' now that we can be who we are - grease is the word
[00:36.29]
[00:36.98]They think our love is just a growin' pain
[00:40.24]Why don't they understand? It's just a cryin' shame
[00:45.81]Their lips are lyin', only real is real
[00:49.30]We stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel - grease is the word
[00:55.20]Grease
[00:55.73](Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
[00:57.94]It's got a groove, it's got a meaning

[01:07.60]Grease is the way we are feeling
[01:14.38]
[01:14.55]We take the pressure, and we throw away conventionality, belongs to yesterday

[01:56.41]Mixed with confusion - what're we doin' here?
[02:07.75]

[02:25.86](Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
