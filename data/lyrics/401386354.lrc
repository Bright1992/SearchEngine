[00:01.78]Darling, darling, oh
[00:04.00]Turn the lights back on now
[00:05.72]Watching, watching
[00:07.45]As the credits all roll down
[00:09.71]Crying, crying
[00:11.54]You know we're playing to a full house, house
[00:16.25]
[00:16.91]No heroes, villains, one to blame
[00:18.93]While wilted roses filled the stage
[00:20.75]And the thrill, the thrill is gone
[00:24.75]Our debut was a masterpiece
[00:26.77]But in the end for you and me
[00:28.69]Oh, the show, it can't go on
[00:31.16]
[00:33.94]We used to have it all
[00:36.02]But now's our curtain call
[00:37.69]So hold for the applause, oh
[00:42.38]And wave out to the crowd
[00:44.19]And take our final bow
[00:46.37]Oh, it's our time to go
[00:48.09]But at least we stole the show
[00:50.37]At least we stole the show
[00:52.44]At least we stole the show
[00:54.31]At least we stole the show
[00:56.33]At least we stole the show
[00:58.05]

[01:25.78]And take our final bow
[01:28.00]Oh, it's our time to go
[01:30.16]But at least we stole the show
[01:32.23]At least we stole the show

[02:46.65]
[02:49.68]Darling, darling
[02:52.01]You know that we are sold out
[02:54.04]Kisses fading
[02:55.93]But the band plays on now
[02:57.64]We're crying, crying
[02:59.41]So let the velvet roll down, down
[03:03.39]
[03:04.45]No heroes, villains, one to blame
[03:06.27]While wilted roses fill the stage
[03:08.29]And the thrill, the thrill is gone
[03:12.33]Our debut was a masterpiece
[03:14.26]Our lines we read so perfectly
[03:17.74]But the show, it can't go on
[03:18.43]
[03:21.16]We used to have it all
[03:23.54]But now's our curtain call
[03:25.46]So hold for the applause, oh

[04:40.96]
[04:42.52]At least we stole the show
[04:46.16]At least we stole the show
[04:49.85]At least we stole the show
