[00:06.660]Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
[00:15.275]And i was reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore
[00:23.156]And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
[00:31.180]For me it happens all the time
[00:37.100]It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
[00:37.400]
[00:45.690]Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
[00:54.150]And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
[01:06.100]
[01:10.250]Another shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door
[01:19.150]And i was wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
[01:27.580]And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
[01:35.629]For me it happens all the time
[01:41.140]
[01:41.200]It's a quarter after one I'm a little drunk and I need you now
[01:58.610]Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
[02:08.109]And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now
[02:11.325]
[02:24.275]Ooh...
[02:40.505]Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
[02:50.205]It's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now
[03:00.195]And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
[03:10.145]And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now
[03:27.535]you now
[03:35.000]I need you now
[03:48.000]I need you now
