[00:16.250]It's been a long time
[00:19.060]since I walked through this old town
[00:24.430]But oh how the memories start to flow
[00:31.370]And there's the old movie house
[00:35.790]They finally closed it down
[00:39.720]You could find me there every Friday night
[00:43.590]Twenty years ago
[00:54.240]转眼之间我们到了 另一个路口
[01:02.250]如歌的青春会寂寞
[01:10.130]风干了眼泪 不说心中藏着谁
[01:17.590]也许有一天 我们错身而过 二十年以前
[01:26.990]All my memories from those days
[01:30.570]come gather round me
[01:34.600]What I'd give if they could take me back in time
[01:43.130]It almost seems like yesterday
[01:47.350]Where do the good times go
[01:53.490]Life was so much easier
[01:58.360]Twenty years ago
[02:07.650]嘲笑你眼角泛红 分明就哭过
[02:15.950]如歌的人儿 也寂寞
[02:23.730]我们曾爱过就不怕 岁月能怎样
[02:31.320]或是你放手 让我忘记你吧 二十年以后
[02:39.970]雁子飞到了遥远的北方
[02:49.220]你的名字我已想不起来
[02:55.710]云的那边 什么也没有
[03:00.790]不过是梦一场
[03:07.230]也许会再见 记得提醒我呀
[03:13.730]二十年以后
[03:59.050]All my memories from those days
[04:03.450]come gather round me
[04:08.100]What I'd give if they could take me back in time
[04:15.670]It almost seems like yesterday
[04:20.240]Where do the good times go
[04:26.460]Life was so much easier
[04:31.160]Twenty years ago
[04:36.770]或是你放手 让我忘记你吧
[04:43.080]二十年以后
