[00:15.37]He left no time to regret,
[00:21.69]Kept his dick wet,
[00:25.19]With his same old safe bet.
[00:30.01]Me & my head high,
[00:37.43]And my tears dry,
[00:41.01]Get on without my guy.
[00:45.55]You went back to what you knew,
[00:52.31]So far removed
[00:56.37]From all that we went through.
[01:01.24]And I tread a troubled track,
[01:07.52]My odds are stacked,
[01:11.51]I go back to black.

[01:16.74]We only said goodbye with words
[01:21.56]I died a hundred times

[01:39.24]I love you much
[01:43.31]It's not enough
[01:45.91]You love blow and I love puff

[02:16.15]You go back to her
[02:19.23]And I go back to...
[02:23.75]We only said goodbye with words
[02:27.88]I died a hundred times
[02:31.68]You go back to her
[02:35.07]And I go back to...
[02:42.99]Black
[02:48.70]Black
[02:52.95]Black
[02:57.10]Black
[03:00.97]Black
[03:05.34]Black
[03:09.66]Black
[03:13.48]I go back to...
[03:18.03]I go back to...
[03:22.05]
[03:22.65]We only said goodbye with words
[03:26.62]I died a hundred times
[03:30.27]You go back to her
[03:33.23]And I go back to
[03:37.24]
[03:37.98]We only said goodbye with words
[03:42.20]I died a hundred times
[03:45.70]You go back to her
[03:48.92]And I go back to black
