[00:00.39]1-2-3-4!
[00:02.06]La la la la la la la
[00:05.88]La la la la la la
[00:12.06]Whatever happened to predictability?
[00:15.42]The milkman, the paperboy, the evening tv?
[00:19.15]How did I get delivered here？
[00:21.09]Somebody tell me please
[00:23.07]Cause this old world is just really confusing me
[00:26.93]Clouds as mean as you've ever seen
[00:30.50]Ain't a bird that knows your tune
[00:34.41]Then a little voice inside of you whispers
[00:38.35]"Kid, don't sell your dreams so soon!"
[00:44.32]Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
[00:48.53]There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold on to
[00:52.13]Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
[00:55.49]There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you
[00:59.62]La la la la la la la
[01:03.42]La la la la la la
[01:07.67]Whatever happened to the good old days?
[01:11.13]Talking to friends for hours, swore it'd never go away
[01:14.77]Now I'm feeling a little crazy, trying to fit in with a scene
[01:18.64]Cause how do you know where you're going, if you really don't know who you've been?
[01:22.67]Everybody eventually
[01:26.06]Says that they're as lost as you
[01:30.28]So everybody shout it together
[01:34.06]"Hey, don't sell your dreams so soon!"
[01:40.41]Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
[01:44.25]There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold on to
[01:47.99]Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
[01:51.07]There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you
[01:55.82]Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
[01:59.55]There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold on to
[02:03.36]Everywhere you look
[02:06.76]When you're lost out there and you're all alone
[02:10.65]A light is waiting to carry you home
[02:15.92]Everywhere you look
[02:18.11](Guitar)
[02:33.08]Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
[02:36.27]There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold on to
[02:40.73]Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
[02:43.71]There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you
[02:48.56]Everywhere you look, yeah
[02:51.94]When you're lost out there and you're all alone
[02:55.71]A light is waiting to carry you home
[03:01.21]Everywhere you look
[03:03.01]La la la la la la la
[03:06.29]La la la la la la
