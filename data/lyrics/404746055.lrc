[00:28.620]25 years and my life is still
[00:31.900]Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
[00:38.450]For a destination
[00:42.960]I realized quickly when I knew I should
[00:46.350]That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
[00:52.120]For whatever that means
[00:55.640]
[00:57.360]And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
[01:00.640]Just to get it all out what's in my head
[01:04.390]And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
[01:11.710]And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
[01:15.280]And I take deep breath and I get real high
[01:19.000]And I scream from the top of my lungs
[01:21.970]What's going on
[01:25.930]And I say hey hey
[01:33.410]I said hey
[01:36.500]What's going on
[01:40.280]And I say hey hey
[01:47.740]I said hey
[01:50.810]What's going on
[01:54.280]
[02:24.670]And I try, oh my God do I try
[02:30.160]I try all the time
[02:33.910]In this institution
[02:38.960]And I pray, oh my God do I pray
[02:44.700]I pray every single day
[02:49.230]For a revolution
[02:52.610]
[02:53.870]And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in my bed
[02:57.080]Just to get it all out what's in my head
[03:00.610]And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
[03:07.810]And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
[03:11.480]And I take a deep breath and I get real high
[03:15.330]And I scream from the top of my lungs.
[03:18.270]What's going on
[03:21.210]
[03:22.280]And I say hey hey
[03:29.550]I said hey
[03:32.600]What's going on
[03:36.760]And I say hey hey
[03:44.010]I said hey
[03:46.980]What's going on
[03:50.000]
[03:51.920]And I say hey hey
