[00:16.41]You were the shadow to my light
[00:18.44]Did you feel us
[00:21.01]Another start
[00:22.43]You fade away
[00:23.74]Afraid your aim is out of sight
[00:25.76]Wanna see us
[00:28.49]Alive
[00:30.36]
[00:30.57]Where are you now
[00:34.16]Where are you now
[00:37.85]Where are you now
[00:39.72]Was it all in my fantasy
[00:41.69]Where are you now
[00:43.50]Were you only imaginary
[00:44.93]
[00:46.24]Where are you now
[01:01.05]
[01:01.26]Where are you now
[01:03.96]
[01:16.50]Where are you now
[01:19.61]
[01:21.13]These shallow waters, never met
[01:22.90]What I needed
[01:25.63]I'm letting go
[01:27.05]A deeper dive
[01:28.46]Eternal silence of the sea
[01:30.68]I'm breathing
[01:33.16]Alive
[01:33.80]
[01:34.66]Where are you now
[01:38.35]Where are you now
[01:42.15]Under the bright
[01:43.70]But faded lights
[01:44.67]You set my heart on fire
[01:46.58]Where are you now
[01:48.71]Where are you now
[01:52.14]Atlantis Atlantis Atlantis
[01:58.27]Where are,where are you now
[02:12.87]
[02:13.83]Where are you now
[02:25.08]
[02:28.76]Where are you now
