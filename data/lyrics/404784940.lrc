[00:00.72]And all I remember is your back
[00:09.77]Walking towards the airport, leaving us all in your past
[00:18.08]I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
[00:28.82]Begged you to want me, but you didn’t want to
[00:36.59]But piece by piece, he collected me
[00:40.40]Up off the ground, where you abandoned things and
[00:45.33]Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
[00:51.44]At six years old
[00:53.76]And you know, he never walks away
[00:56.52]He never asks for money
[00:58.78]He takes care of me, he loves me
[01:02.82]Piece by piece, he restored my faith
[01:07.64]That a man can be kind and a father could stay
[01:18.59]And all of your words fall flat
[01:25.88]I made something of myself and now you want to come back
[01:35.21]But your love, it isn’t free, it has to be earned
[01:43.34]Back then I didn’t have anything you needed so I was worthless
[01:52.93]But piece by piece, he collected me
[01:56.77]Up off the ground, where you abandoned things and
[02:01.07]Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
[02:07.42]At six years old
[02:09.80]And you know, he never walks away
[02:12.65]He never asks for money
[02:14.70]He takes care of me, he loves me
[02:18.72]Piece by piece,he restored my faith
[02:23.77]That a man can be kind and a father could stay
[02:32.45]Piece by piece
[02:37.39]Piece by piece I fell far from the tree
[02:41.24]I will never leave her like you left me
[02:45.35]And she will never have to wonder her worth
[02:49.36]Because unlike you I’m going to put her first
[02:53.61]And you know...
[02:54.51]He’ll never walk away
[02:56.56]He’ll never break her heart
[02:58.66]He’ll take care of things, he’ll love her
[03:03.63]Piece by piece, he restored my faith
[03:07.84]That a man can be kind and a father should be great
[03:17.49]Piece by piece
[03:22.45]Piece by piece
