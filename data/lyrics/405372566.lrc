[00:16.15]I thought that I'd been hurt before
[00:22.98]But no one's ever left me quite this sore
[00:31.64]Your words cut deeper than a knife
[00:37.86]Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
[00:46.86]Got a feeling that I'm going under
[00:50.90]But I know that I'll make it out alive
[00:55.03]If I quit calling you my lover
[00:58.33]Move on
[01:00.62]You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
[01:04.76]Shaking, falling onto my knees
[01:08.70]And now that I'm without your kisses
[01:13.28]I'll be needing stitches
[01:17.47]Tripping over myself
[01:20.31]Aching, begging you to come help
[01:24.04]And now that I'm without your kisses
[01:28.72]I'll be needing stitches
[01:33.32]Just like a moth drawn to a flame
[01:39.89]Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
[01:48.60]Your bitter heart cold to the touch
[01:54.74]Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
[01:58.67]I'm left seeing red on my own
[02:04.24]Got a feeling that I'm going under
[02:08.08]But I know that I'll make it out alive
[02:12.11]If I quit calling you my lover
[02:15.55]Move on
[02:17.67]You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
[02:21.20]Shaking, falling onto my knees
[02:26.13]And now that I'm without your kisses
[02:31.21]I'll be needing stitches
[02:34.94]Tripping over myself,
[02:37.33]Aching, begging you to come help
[02:41.46]And now that I'm without your kisses
[02:46.39]I'll be needing stitches
[03:21.38][03:06.22]Needle and the thread,
[03:23.02][03:07.42]Gotta get you out of my head
[03:25.06][03:17.60][03:21.45]Needle and the thread,
[03:26.57][03:19.09][03:22.89]Gonna wind up dead
[03:28.96][03:13.46]Needle and the thread,
[03:30.86][03:15.10]Gotta get you out of my head
[03:35.71]You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
[03:41.73]Shaking, falling onto my knees
[03:45.96]And now that I'm without your kisses
[03:50.44]I'll be needing stitches
[03:54.33]Tripping over myself,
[03:57.31]Aching, begging you to come help
[04:02.14]And now that I'm without your kisses
[04:05.92]I'll be needing stitches
