[01:14.21]I'm a flame
[01:15.88]You're the fire
[01:18.20]I'm the dark in need of light
[01:21.82]When we touch, you inspire
[01:25.52]Feel the change in me tonight
[01:29.51]So take me up, take me higher
[01:33.00]There's a world not far from here
[01:36.74]We can dance in desire
[01:40.03]Or we can burn in love tonight
[01:43.06]
[01:45.63]Our hearts are like firestones
[01:49.65]And when they strike, we feel the love
[01:53.55]Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
[01:57.14]And when they strike, we light up the world
[02:01.54]Our hearts are like firestones
[02:04.48]And when they strike, we feel the love
[02:08.37]Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
[02:11.91]But when they strike, we light up the world
[02:16.92]We light up the world
[02:33.76]We light up the world
[02:49.21]We light up the world
[02:58.32]
