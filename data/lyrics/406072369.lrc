[00:00.05]Loving can hurt
[00:04.52]Loving can hurt sometimes
[00:08.89]But it's the only thing
[00:11.88]That I know
[00:17.32]And when it gets hard
[00:21.75]You know it can get hard sometimes
[00:26.94]It is the only thing makes us feel alive
[00:36.98]We keep this love in a photograph
[00:41.39]We make these memories for ourselves
[00:44.80]Where our eyes are never closing
[00:47.45]Hearts are never broken
[00:49.77]And time's forever frozen still
[00:53.50]So you can keep me
[00:56.50]Inside the pocket
[00:58.06]Of your ripped jeans
[01:01.01]Holdin' me closer
[01:02.32]Till our eyes meet
[01:05.30]You won't ever be alone
[01:10.04]Wait for me to come home
[01:16.21]
[01:46.72]Loving can heal
[01:50.70]Loving can mend your soul
[01:55.18]And is the only thing
[01:57.81]That I know
[02:05.65]I swear it will get easier
[02:07.54]Remember that with every piece of ya
[02:12.88]And it's the only thing we take with us when we die
[02:23.45]We keep this love in a photograph
[02:27.72]We make these memories for ourselves
[02:31.02]Where our eyes are never closing
[02:33.70]Our hearts were never broken
[02:35.69]And times forever frozen still
[02:39.67]So you can keep me
[02:42.67]Inside the pocket
[02:44.23]Of your ripped jeans
[02:47.12]Holdin' me closer
[02:48.76]Till our eyes meet
[02:51.50]You won't ever be alone
[02:57.01]Wait for me to come home
[02:59.17]
[03:14.81]Wait for me to come home
[03:19.32]Wait for me to come home
[03:23.44]Wait for me to come home
[03:27.65]Wait for me to come home
[03:31.30]
[03:33.60]When I'm away
[03:36.59]I will remember how you kissed me
[03:40.92]Under the lamppost
[03:42.70]Back on 6th street
[03:45.44]Hearing you whisper through the phone
[03:49.75]Wait for me to come home
[03:54.38]Wait for me to come home
