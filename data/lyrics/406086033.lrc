[00:01.550]We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
[00:06.030]We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[00:10.730]We don't laugh anymore
[00:13.160]What was all of it for?
[00:15.280]Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[00:19.070]
[00:20.230]I just heard you found the one you've been looking
[00:23.670]You've been looking for
[00:25.840]I wish I would have known that wasn't me
[00:29.180]Cause even after all this time I still wonder
[00:32.830]Why I can't move on
[00:35.260]Just the way you did so easily
[00:38.050]
[00:39.050]Don't wanna know
[00:41.180]What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
[00:43.210]If he's holding onto you so tight
[00:45.700]The way I did before
[00:48.070]I overdosed
[00:50.300]Should've known your love was a game
[00:52.630]Now I can't get you out of my brain
[00:54.960]Oh, it's such a shame
[00:56.780]
[00:58.700]We don't talk anymore
[01:11.600]
[01:18.730]We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
[01:23.540]We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[01:27.930]We don't laugh anymore
[01:30.260]What was all of it for?
[01:32.680]Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[01:36.590]
[01:37.350]I just hope you're lying next to somebody
[01:40.540]Who knows how to love you like me
[01:43.010]There must be a good reason that you're gone
[01:46.560]Every now and then I think you
[01:49.440]Might want me to come show up at your door
[01:52.570]But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
[01:55.220]
[01:56.480]Don't wanna know
[01:58.400]What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
[02:02.050]If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
[02:05.890]I overdosed
[02:07.560]Should've known your love was a game
[02:09.780]Now I can't get you out of my brain
[02:12.210]Oh, it's such a shame
[02:13.790]
[02:16.210]We don't talk anymore
[02:26.630]
[02:35.750]We don't talk anymore
[03:00.240]
