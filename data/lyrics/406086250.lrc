[00:16.14]I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
[00:24.55]I can tell by the way you carry yourself
[00:30.93]If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
[00:37.14]I’ll take care of you
[00:40.23]
[00:47.06]I’ve asked about you and they told me things
[00:50.69]But my mind didn’t change
[00:52.57]And I still feel the same
[00:54.24]What's a life with no fun?
[00:56.60]Please don’t be so ashamed
[00:58.62]I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours we both know
[01:02.16]We know
[01:16.82]
[01:17.43]I’ve loved and I’ve lost
[01:24.97]I’ve loved and I’ve lost
[01:27.60]
[01:33.92]They don’t get you like I will
[01:35.37]My only wish is I die real
[01:37.28]Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
[01:39.30]And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
[01:41.08]So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
[01:43.31]Big girls all get a little taste,ah
[01:45.78]Pushing me away so I give her space,ah
[01:47.55]Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
[01:49.43]I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
[01:50.95]I keep thinking you just don’t know
[01:52.97]Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
[01:54.88]On your face girl, it just don’t show
[01:56.75]When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
[01:58.48]When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
[02:00.60]And the party's over, just don’t forget me
[02:02.38]We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
[02:04.86]You won’t ever have to worry
[02:08.49]You won’t ever have to hide
[02:12.33]You've seen all my mistakes
[02:15.98]So look me in my eyes
[02:19.21]
[02:34.31]I’ve loved and I’ve lost
[02:42.04]I’ve loved and I’ve lost
[02:43.67]
[02:51.52]I’ve asked about you and they told me things
[02:54.66]But my mind didn’t change
[02:56.58]And I still feel the same
[02:58.71]What's a life with no fun?
[03:00.51]Please don’t be so ashamed
[03:02.48]I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours we both know
[03:05.20]
[03:06.84]If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
[03:12.39]I’ll take care of you
[03:16.02]
[03:21.10]I’ve loved and I’ve lost
[03:28.77]I’ve loved and I’ve lost
[03:36.16]I’ve loved and I’ve lost
