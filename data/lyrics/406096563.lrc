[00:03.83]Flashback to the time of my life
[00:06.82]When we thought the world was easy
[00:11.26]But its hard when you take on the world alone
[00:18.85]One shot that you fire at the sky
[00:21.78]Hoping someone else can see it
[00:24.92]
[00:26.38]Just a sign that you're not out there on your own
[00:32.41]We come home tonight
[00:35.67]I've been waiting for your wake up call
[00:39.96]Growing stronger now
[00:42.59]I can hear it in this thunderstorm
[00:47.29]We sing, Oh oh oh oh oh oh
[00:52.39]I don't want to do this without you
[00:54.93]Oh oh oh oh oh oh
[00:59.47]I won't let go now that I've found you
[01:01.69]
[01:02.25]Now that I've found you found you found you...
[01:17.77]Oh oh oh oh oh oh
[01:22.39]I don't want to do this without you
[01:24.81]Oh oh oh oh oh oh
[01:29.66]I won't let go now that I've found you
[01:32.39]Now that I've found you
[01:35.88]
[01:36.99]Stop saying I could never go back
[01:40.03]To the city you built for dreamers
[01:44.58]But I know we can find it on our own
[01:52.01]One shot that we fire at the sky
[01:55.15]But this time we are together
[01:59.54]Right here through this moment that we belong
[02:05.71]We come home tonight
[02:09.00]I've been waiting for your wake up call
[02:13.34]Growing stronger now
[02:16.58]I can hear it in this thunderstorm
[02:20.63]We sing
[02:21.54]Oh oh oh oh oh oh
[02:25.43]I don't want to do this without you
[02:28.15]Oh oh oh oh oh oh
[02:32.87]I won't let go now that I've found you
[02:35.19]
[02:35.65]Now that I've found you found you found you...
[02:51.55]Now that I've found you found you found you...
[02:59.09]Oh oh oh oh oh oh
[03:03.65]I won't let go now that I've found you
[03:06.38]Now that I've found you
