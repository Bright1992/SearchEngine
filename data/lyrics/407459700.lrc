[00:11.56]You were the shadow to my light
[00:14.45]Did you feel us
[00:17.79]Another start
[00:20.47]You fade away
[00:22.43]Afraid our aim is out of sight
[00:25.36]Wanna see us
[00:28.65]Alive
[00:30.02]
[00:31.98]Where are you now
[00:37.30]Where are you now
[00:42.75]Where are you now
[00:45.53]Was it all in my fantasy
[00:48.22]Where are you now
[00:50.95]Were you only imaginary
[00:56.45]
[01:39.76]I'm faded
[01:41.73]These shallow waters, never met
[01:44.47]What I needed
[01:48.27]I'm letting go
[01:50.23]A deeper dive
[01:52.16]Eternal silence of the sea
[01:54.99]I'm breathing
[01:58.22]Alive
[02:02.02]Where are you now
[02:07.43]Where are you now
[02:13.14]Under the bright
[02:14.31]But faded lights
[02:15.51]You set my heart on fire
[02:18.35]Where are you now
[02:21.12]Where are you now
[02:23.61]Where are you now
[02:29.15]Where are you now
[02:34.61]Where are you now
[02:37.66]Was it all in my fantasy
[02:40.29]Where are you now
[02:43.07]Were you only imaginary
[02:49.04]Where are you now
[02:52.47]Atlantis
[02:54.49]Under the sea
[02:57.23]Under the sea
[02:59.96]Where are you now
[03:03.09]Another dream
[03:06.02]The monsters running wild inside of me
[03:10.22]I'm faded
[03:15.79]I'm faded
[03:19.52]So lost
[03:21.48]I'm faded
[03:26.63]I'm faded
[03:30.43]So lost
[03:32.20]I'm faded
