[00:02.10]I'm the shhh, be quiet
[00:04.12]I've been on a low-hater diet
[00:06.50]I'm the shhh, be quiet
[00:08.39]I've been on a low-hater diet
[00:10.48]Cause I just woke up and I feel some type of way
[00:14.72]I get all choked up when I see how much I made
[00:19.06]And I feel so good like James Bond in his day
[00:23.44]Singing hey, hey, hey
[00:27.78]Watch me do, watch me
[00:31.88]Watch me do, watch me
[00:36.27]Wha-da-do, watch me
[00:40.64]Let me hear you sing hey, hey, hey
[00:45.21]I ain't saying I'm the besteses
[00:47.27]But I got nice curves, nice breasteses
[00:49.35]I don't erase the textes from my exeses
[00:51.47]All in my DMs, leaving messages
[00:53.66]Whoo, head spinning like an exorcist
[00:55.75]And I ain't a teacher, but the lesson is
[00:57.78]If you wonder how I make it look effortless
[01:00.00]The answer to your question is
[01:02.19]That I just woke up and I feel some type of way
[01:06.02]I get all choked up when I see how much I made
[01:10.44]And I feel so good like James Bond in his day
[01:14.92]Singing hey, hey, hey
[01:19.05]Watch me do, watch me
[01:23.36]Watch me do, I said watch me
[01:27.42]Oh, wha-da-do, watch me
[01:31.81]Let me hear you sing hey, hey, hey
[01:36.71]I'm the shhh, be quiet
[01:38.39]I've been on a low-hater diet
[01:40.27]I'm the shhh, be quiet
[01:42.57]I've been on a low-hater diet
[01:44.68]I'm the shhh, be quiet
[01:46.87]I've been on a low-hater diet
[01:49.10]I'm the shhh, be quiet
[01:51.19]I've been on a low-hater diet
[01:53.32]Cause I just woke up (Good morning!)
[01:56.06]And I feel some type of way
[01:57.62]I get all choked up when I see how much I made
[02:01.93]And I feel so good like James Bond in his day
[02:06.32]Singing hey
