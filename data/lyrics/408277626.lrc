[00:09.19]For all the times that you rain on my parade
[00:14.04]And all the clubs you get in using my name
[00:18.64]You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness sake
[00:23.45]You think I'm crying oh my oh well no I ain't
[00:28.01]And I didn't wanna write a song cause
[00:30.79]I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
[00:33.72]I don't but you still hit my phone up
[00:37.96]And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
[00:42.15]I don't wanna hold back maybe you should know that
[00:47.32]My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
[00:51.92]And I never like to admit that I was wrong
[00:56.72]And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on
[01:01.56]And now I know I'm better sleeping on my own
[01:06.27]Cause if you like the way you look that much
[01:10.87]Oh baby you should go and love yourself
[01:15.83]And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
[01:21.14]You should go and love yourself
[01:43.13]Say you'll never let me go
[01:45.58]But when you told me that you hated my friends
[01:49.83]The only problem was with you and not them
[01:54.58]And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
[01:59.39]And tried to make me forget where I came from
[02:04.22]And I didn't wanna write a song
[02:06.50]Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
[02:09.92]I don't but you still hit my phone up
[02:13.86]And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
[02:18.36]I don't wanna hold back maybe you should know that
[02:23.49]My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
[02:28.18]And I never like to admit that I was wrong
[02:32.79]And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on
[02:37.69]And now I know I'm better sleeping on my own
[02:41.85]Cause if you like the way you look that much
[02:47.20]Oh baby you should go and love yourself
[02:52.21]And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
[02:57.23]You should go and love yourself
[03:19.22]Say you'll never let me go
[03:28.08]Say you'll never let me go
