[00:01.35]It's the strangest feeling
[00:03.39]Feeling this way for you
[00:05.21]There's something in the way you move
[00:06.78]Something in the way you move
[00:08.20]With you I’m never healing
[00:10.18]It’s heartache through and through
[00:11.75]There's something in the way you move
[00:13.47]I don’t know what it is you do
[00:14.89]Not one bone in your body good enough for me
[00:18.54]But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
[00:21.93]When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
[00:24.98]But tonight I'm here, yours again
[00:28.63]But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
[00:31.82]Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
[00:35.43]Heart is sinking like a cannonball
[00:38.83]Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?
[00:42.60]Something in the way you move
[00:44.28]There's something in the way you do it
[00:46.11]Something in the way you move
[00:47.38]Oh
[00:49.42]There's something in the way you move
[00:51.17]Something in the way you do it
[00:52.99]Something in the way you move
[00:54.36]Oh
[01:23.57]There's an evil night air, the stars don't shine tonight,
[01:27.12]There's something in the way you do
[01:28.76]There's something in the way you
[01:30.41]Push me closer, further
[01:32.34]Break me just enough
[01:33.92]Your lies always seem so true
[01:35.64]There's nothing left for me to lose
[01:36.92]There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
[01:40.60]But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
[01:44.23]When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
[01:47.22]And tonight the rain pours again
[01:50.73]But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
[01:53.97]Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
[01:57.47]Heart is sinking like a cannonball
[02:00.87]Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?
[02:04.77]Something in the way you move
[02:06.45]There's something in the way you do it
[02:08.22]Something in the way you move
[02:09.51]Oh
[02:11.39]There's something in the way you move
[02:13.20]Something in the way you do it
[02:14.99]Something in the way you move
[02:16.33]Oh
