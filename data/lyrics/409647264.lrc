[00:17.490]I see what you're wearing
[00:19.190]there's nothing beneath it
[00:22.190]Forgive me for staring, forgive me for breathing
[00:26.190]We might not know why, we might not know how
[00:30.190]But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
[00:32.190]We're beautiful now
[00:35.190]We're beautiful now
[00:38.250]We're beautiful now
[00:43.138]We might not know why, we might not know how
[00:47.138]But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
[01:06.000]We're beautiful now
[01:38.000]We're beautiful now
[01:41.000]Wherever it's going, I'm gonna chase it
[01:45.000]What's left of this moment, I'm not gonna waste it
[01:50.000]Stranded together, our worlds have collided
[01:54.000]This won't be forever, so why try to fight it
[01:58.000]We're beautiful now
[02:00.000]We're beautiful now
[02:06.000]We might not know why, we might not know how
[02:10.138]But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
