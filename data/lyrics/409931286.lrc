[00:06.38]
[00:17.98]Party girls don't get hurt
[00:20.06]Can't feel anything, when will I learn
[00:23.43]I push it down, push it down
[00:29.37]I'm the one "for a good time call"
[00:31.75]Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
[00:34.78]I feel the love, feel the love
[00:40.45]1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink
[00:43.38]1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink
[00:46.24]1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink
[00:49.54]Throw 'em back, till I lose count
[00:52.35]I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
[01:03.52]I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
[01:11.57]Like it doesn't exist
[01:15.01]I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
[01:25.85]I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
[01:36.62]But I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
[01:41.81]Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
[01:47.65]Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
[01:53.13]Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
[01:58.84]On for tonight
[02:00.49]Sun is up, I'm a mess
[02:02.98]Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
[02:05.88]Here comes the shame, here comes the shame
[02:11.56]1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink
[02:14.51]1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink
[02:17.36]1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3 drink
[02:20.33]Throw 'em back till I lose count
[02:23.45]I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
[02:34.66]I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
[02:42.66]Like it doesn't exist
[02:46.28]I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
[02:57.23]I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
[03:08.19]But I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes
[03:13.25]Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
[03:19.20]Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes

[03:32.48]On for tonight
[03:34.99]'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
[03:38.23]Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
[03:40.47]On for tonight
[03:41.92]On for tonight
[03:43.69]'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
[03:47.12]Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
[03:50.48]On for tonight
[03:55.63][03:52.52]On for tonight
