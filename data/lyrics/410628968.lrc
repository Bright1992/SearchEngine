[al:Thank You (Deluxe)]
[00:12.22]Finally blew up in my face
[00:15.06]Crash and burnt to pieces
[00:17.77]You got what you want from me
[00:20.47]I gave you what you needed
[00:23.36]I was warned but fooled by charm
[00:28.56]And you, deserve to be alone
[00:33.36]And I deserve better, better than you
[00:38.85]I deserve better, better than you
[00:44.74]I deserve better
[00:48.52]Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
[00:54.11]Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
[00:56.99]I used to cry to all my friends
[00:59.63]But they would say, "I told ya"
[01:02.79]Finally I can breathe again
[01:05.09]The weight is off my shoulders
[01:08.04]I was warned but fooled by charm
[01:13.08]And you, you deserve to be alone
[01:17.87]And I deserve better, better than you
[01:23.58]I deserve better, better than you
[01:29.12]I deserve better
[01:33.37]Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
[01:38.61]Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
[01:42.06]Let's talk about the word "deserve"
[01:43.96]Or talk 'bout the world deserves a queen (You queen)
[01:47.66]Let's talk about that four letter word: love
[01:49.90]I think you deserve a king
[01:51.90]I think you deserve the world and everything in it
[01:55.10]And I try to go get it to show you I meant it when I
[01:58.19]Tell you I'm sorry, tomorrow I promise that I
[02:00.90]Try to better, I'll do whatever for mine
[02:03.89]And I ain't tryna be your friend's friends
[02:06.29]Or your quote unquote fake friend, that's why I hate friends
[02:09.78]I'd rather see you land to see you cry
[02:12.09]I'd rather see you lead and tell a lie
[02:15.50]And you ain't gotta say it, you deserve better
[02:16.99]I deserve better, better than you
[02:22.35]I deserve better, better than you
[02:28.03]I deserve better
[02:31.72]Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
[02:37.27]Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
