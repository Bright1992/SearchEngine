[00:08.69]Stars fall at my feet, keep me grounded as I reach
[00:17.18]Higher than I see, is there something there for me?
[00:25.35]Pulling back the reins, letting go again
[00:33.44]I'm not afraid, I'm not
[00:38.29]All my life, one page at a time
[00:45.71]I'll show you my, my true colors
[00:52.94]No I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
[01:00.27]Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't no rainbow
[01:10.64]A promise with a lie is broken by design
[01:18.27]What we thought we knew, has been swallowed by the truth
[01:25.92]It's time to light the flame, right before it rains
[01:34.24]I'm not afraid, I'm not
[01:38.95]
[01:39.40]All my life, one page at a time
[01:46.46]I'll show you my, my true colors
[01:53.75]No I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
[02:01.62]Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't no rainbow
[02:10.74]Something tells me I know nothing at all
[02:18.98]I've escaped my capture
[02:22.32]And I have no masters
[02:26.55]And somehow it's like I've waited
[02:32.59]All my life, one page at a time
[02:39.80]I'll show you my, my true colors
[02:46.40]No I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
[02:54.54]Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't no rainbow
[03:08.67]It ain't no rainbow  it ain't no rainbow it ain't no rainbow..
