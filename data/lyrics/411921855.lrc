[00:08.15]I got this feeling inside my bones
[00:12.28]It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
[00:16.53]All through my city, all through my home
[00:20.76]We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone
[00:24.46]I got that sunshine in my pocket
[00:27.42]Got that good song in my feet
[00:29.51]I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
[00:33.93]I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
[00:38.08]You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop
[00:42.00]Under the lights when everything goes
[00:46.18]Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
[00:50.46]When we move, well, you already know
[00:54.77]So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
[00:59.82]Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
[01:03.64]Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
[01:05.74]So just dance, dance, dance, come on
[01:08.28]All those things I should do to you
[01:10.31]But you dance, dance, dance
[01:12.19]And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
[01:15.92]I can't stop the feeling
[01:18.55]So just dance, dance, dance
[01:20.26]I can't stop the feeling
[01:22.74]So just dance, dance, dance, come on
[01:25.57]Ooh, it's something magical
[01:28.67]It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
[01:32.94]I don't need no reason, don't need control
[01:37.20]I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
[01:40.94]Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
[01:43.76]Got that good song in my feet
[01:46.00]I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
[01:50.33]I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
[01:54.57]You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop

[03:44.20]Got this feeling in my body
[03:47.06]Can't stop the feeling
[03:48.17]Got this feeling in my body, come on
