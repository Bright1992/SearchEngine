[00:14.26]So cold, alone
[00:17.97]Could you be my blanket?
[00:20.36]Surround my bones
[00:24.55]When my heart feels naked
[00:26.95]No strength, too weak
[00:30.76]I could use some saving
[00:32.99]And you're love's so strong
[00:38.42]Like a pill I take it, I take it, I take it
[00:43.28]Like a pill, your love, I take it
[00:45.57]I take it, I take it
[00:49.24]Like a pill, your love, I take it
[00:52.22]When my world gets loud, could you make it quiet down?
[00:58.58]When my head, it pounds, could you turn down all the sound?
[01:05.10]If I lay in pain, by my side would you stay?

[01:17.71]Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, would you kindly calm me down?
[01:23.78]Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, would you kindly calm me down?

[01:37.94]Would you kill my disease?
[01:40.28]And when there's no cure
[01:44.20]You are just what I need
[01:46.66]When I lose my mind
[01:50.61]Would you still remind me?
[01:53.00]When I'm feeling lost
[01:56.77]Would you come and find me?
[01:59.75]I'd take it, I would take it
[02:02.70]Like a pill, your love, I take it
[02:05.76]I take it, I take it
[02:09.31]Like a pill, your love, I take it
