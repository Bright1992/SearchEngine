[00:11.98]We're born to fly
[00:14.66]So let's keep living 'til it all falls down
[00:20.59]Let's close our eyes
[00:23.36]And let the moment drive the whole world out
[00:28.10]We're in this together
[00:32.13]Hear our hearts beat together
[00:36.91]We stand strong together
[00:41.24]We're in this forever
[00:53.03]This one's for you
[01:01.74]This one's for you
[01:05.07]
[01:25.86]Waving colored flags
[01:28.84]We won't surrender, there's no standing down
[01:34.47]There's a playing field
[01:37.55]It's full of winners, we're breaking new ground
[01:42.43]We're in this together
[01:46.36]Hear our hearts beat together
[01:50.83]We stand strong together
[01:55.27]We're in this forever
[02:07.35]This one's for you
[02:16.15]This one's for you
[02:21.21]
[02:39.92]In this together
[02:43.30]Woah, woah
[02:48.78]Oooooh
[02:56.70]We're in this together
[03:00.78]Hear our hearts beat together
[03:05.35]We stand strong together
[03:09.73]We're in this forever
[03:21.46]This one's for you
