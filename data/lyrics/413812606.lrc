[00:07]I could be staring at somebody new
[00:10]But stuck in my head is a picture of you
[00:14]You were the thunder I was the rain
[00:18]I wanna know if I’ll see you again
[00:22]I said I love you, you said goodbye
[00:26]Everything changes in the blink of an eye
[00:30]It’s been a while, I still carry the flame
[00:34]I wanna know if I’ll see you again
[00:38]See you again
[00:42]See you again
[00:46]Want you to know
[00:48]What you mean to me
[00:50]What would it take
[00:52]Take you to see
[00:53]I could put a little stardust in your eyes
[00:58]Put a little sunshine in your life
[01:01]Give me a little hope you feel the same
[01:05]And I wanna know if I'll see you again
[01:09]Will I see you again
[01:10]I feel like a fool
[01:11]'Cause you're not even there
[01:13]I'm writing this song
[01:15]And you don't even care
[01:17]Throw me a life Iine
[01:19]And open the door
[01:21]And pick up my heart
[01:23]that you left on the floor
[01:25]On the floor
[01:29]On the floor
[01:34]Want you to know
[01:35]What you mean to me
[01:37]What would it take
[01:39]Take you to see
[01:40]I could put a little stardust in your eyes
[01:45]Put a little sunshine in your life
[01:49]Give me a little hope you feel the same
[01:53]And I wanna know if I'll see you again
[01:57]finding have the times go rushing by
[02:00]And all the little things we leave behind
[02:04]But isn't everything that I do
[02:08]Is a little bit of me
[02:10]And a little bit of you
[02:12]When will I see you again
[02:16]When will I see you again
[02:20]
[02:24]When will I see you again
[02:36]When will I see you again
[02:43]I could put a little stardust in your eyes
[02:48]Put a little sunshine in your life
[02:52]Give me a little hope you feel the same
[02:56]And I wanna know if I'll see you again
[03:00]See you again
[03:03]When will I see you again
[03:07]
[03:12]When will I see you again
