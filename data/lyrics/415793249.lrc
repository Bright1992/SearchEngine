[00:01.54]I got this feeling inside my bones
[00:05.68]It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
[00:09.97]All through my city, all through my home
[00:13.60]We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone
[00:17.74]I got that sunshine in my pocket
[00:20.39]Got that good soul in my feet
[00:22.28]I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
[00:25.66]I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
[00:30.45]Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
[00:33.35]And under the lights when everything goes
[00:38.26]Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
[00:41.95]When you move, well, we already know
[00:46.58]So just imagine, just imagine
[00:50.14]
[00:50.74]Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
[00:54.97]A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
[00:57.07]So just dance, dance, dance
[00:59.21]All those things I shouldn't do
[01:01.25]But you dance, dance, dance
[01:03.10]And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
[01:06.64]I can't stop the feeling
[01:13.59]So just dance, dance, dance
[01:15.08]I can't stop the feeling
[01:23.50]So just dance, dance, dance
[01:21.73]
[01:23.82]Ooh, it's something magical
[01:27.11]It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
[01:30.85]Don't need no reason, I don't need control
[01:35.03]I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
[01:38.46]Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
[01:41.45]Got that good soul in my feet
[01:43.61]I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
[01:46.54]I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
[01:51.57]Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
[01:55.16]And under the lights when everything goes
[01:59.15]Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
[02:03.29]When we move, well, you already know
[02:07.33]So just imagine, just imagine
[02:09.96]
[02:13.97]Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
[02:16.36]Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
[02:18.70]So just dance, dance, dance, come on
[02:20.20]All those things I shouldn't do
[02:22.64]But you dance, dance, dance
[02:24.28]And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
[02:27.85]I can't stop the feeling
[02:30.39]So just dance, dance, dance
[02:32.14]I can't stop the feeling
[02:34.28]So just dance, dance, dance
[02:36.12]I can't stop the music
[02:38.41]So just dance, dance, dance
