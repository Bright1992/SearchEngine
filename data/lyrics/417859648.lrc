[00:11.42]Bleak winds roar in the wilderness
[00:16.62]Coldness numbs the senses
[00:21.60]The haze of obscurity haunts our path
[00:26.89]Darkness falls upon us
[00:31.59]Tender kisses kindle a blaze of hope
[00:37.02]Bringing us warmth, lighting our path
[00:41.91]After the dark there will be dawn
[00:47.25]Nothing can break us apart
[00:54.54]Let pain pervade our flesh
[00:59.34]Let cold congeal our blood
[01:05.08]Let havoc crush us down to the ground
[01:10.28]But we will still be one
[01:14.71]In each other that we love
[01:19.95]In each other that we trust
[01:25.14]May our love guide us through the dark
[01:30.72]Forever we are one
[01:36.03]Forever we are one
[01:52.07]Bleak winds roar in the wilderness
[01:56.96]Coldness numbs the senses

[02:07.18]Darkness falls upon us
[02:11.36]Tender kisses kindle a blaze of hope
[02:17.10]Bringing us warmth, lighting our path
[02:22.44]After the dark there will be dawn
[02:27.22]Nothing can break us apart
[02:34.80]Let pain pervade our flesh
[02:39.73]Let cold congeal our blood
[02:44.87]Let havoc crush us down to the ground
[02:50.64]But we will still be one
[02:55.18]In each other that we love
