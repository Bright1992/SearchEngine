[00:10.90]We break into your car
[00:13.24]You cry at every turn
[00:20.53]I say you gotta have faith
[00:22.96]You've gotta let it burn
[00:29.95]You wanna know how everyone seems to cope
[00:39.60]And oh while the heart aches how do they make it stop
[00:44.86]You only see the rain I see rainbows
[00:48.74]Come companion
[00:51.22]Come and rest your head again
[00:53.75]Someday we'll be dead and gone
[00:58.50]Go go go ahead
[01:00.80]We don't have to feel so bad
[01:03.32]We're not meant to be alone
[01:07.45]　
[01:28.92]You're stuck in your apartment
[01:31.25]Hiding behind the shades
[01:38.34]You're dwelling on your problems
[01:40.74]I watch you waste away
[01:47.79]Planets are aligned and you'll find
[01:50.59]It's in your favor
[01:52.50]Stars will fall and then you will rise
[01:55.41]You will get braver
[01:57.48]When the sun explodes in our sky
[02:00.10]Nothing can save us
[02:04.87]Nothing can save us
[02:07.13]Come companion
[02:09.35]Come and rest your head again
[02:11.60]Someday we'll be dead and gone
[02:16.43]Go go go ahead
[02:18.78]We don't have to feel so bad
[02:21.22]We're not meant to be alone
[02:26.17]　
[02:56.75]Do you know I know you can't see other things
[03:03.40]Other things other things than this
[03:06.35]Do you know I know you just want out of it
[03:13.00]Out of it out of it so
[03:15.48]Come companion
[03:17.76]Come and rest your head again
[03:20.30]Someday we'll be dead and gone
