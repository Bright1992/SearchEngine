[00:10.53]You were the shadow to my light
[00:12.87]Did you feel us?
[00:16.40]Another star
[00:17.79]You fade away
[00:19.86]Afraid our aim is out of sight
[00:22.27]Wanna see us
[00:25.31]Alive
[00:28.39]Where are you now?
[00:31.71]Atlantis
[00:33.31]Under the sea
[00:35.59]Under the sea
[00:38.29]Where are you now
[00:40.58]Another dream
[00:43.42]The monsters running wild inside of me
[00:47.00]I'm faded
[00:54.58]
[01:08.12]These shallow waters, never met
[01:10.17]What I needed
[01:13.49]I'm letting go
[01:15.23]A deeper dive
[01:17.28]Eternal silence of the sea
[01:19.82]I'm breathing
[01:22.17]Alive
[01:25.87]Where are you
[01:28.34]Was it all in my fantasy?
[01:35.67]Where are you now?
[01:38.81]Atlantis
[01:40.40]Under the sea
[01:42.74]Under the sea
[01:45.29]Where are you now
[01:47.58]Another dream
[01:50.47]The monsters running wild inside of me
[01:54.80]I'm faded
[01:56.36]Under the bright but faded lights
[01:57.25]You've set my heart on fire
[01:59.00]Where are you now
[02:02.08]Where are you now
[02:05.88]Another dream,another dream,another dream..
