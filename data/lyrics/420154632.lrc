[00:11.07]I'll pick you up at the same time
[00:13.45]The same places the same old drive
[00:15.76]
[00:21.00]We'll just talk about our day
[00:22.94]
[00:23.45]To try to fill in all our space of night
[00:26.51]
[00:30.99]We'll play the songs we used to love
[00:33.41]While we try to fall in love again
[00:36.62]
[00:41.03]We don't know who's wrong or right
[00:43.07]
[00:43.69]We don't even care enough to fight
[00:46.51]
[00:49.29]We're going through the motions
[00:52.40]
[00:54.03]'Cos we can't fix what's broken
[00:56.40]
[00:59.79]And I know it's gonna hurt
[01:02.07]
[01:02.93]But darling I'll go first
[01:04.64]
[01:05.40]'Cos I won't keep on saying those three empty words
[01:09.64]
[01:10.25]No I won't keep on saying those three empty words

[01:26.09]We're still talking everyday
[01:27.93]
[01:28.54]I'm running out of things to say to ya
[01:31.65]
[01:35.96]It's really gonna break my heart
[01:38.42]To have to tell your little brother
[01:41.38]
[01:45.98]It might be easier to stay
[01:48.68]But it'll never be the same no
[01:51.58]
[01:56.12]And if something doesn't change
[01:58.12]
[01:58.64]Then we'll keep on sinking further
[02:01.43]
[02:04.33]We're going through the motion
[02:06.70]
[02:09.17]'Cos we can't fix what's broken
[02:11.54]
[02:14.80]And I know it's gonna hurt
[02:17.05]
[02:17.81]But darling I'll go first
[02:19.68]
[02:20.43]'Cos I won't keep on saying those three empty words
[02:24.55]
[02:25.22]Those three empty words
[02:27.04]
[02:27.63]Will lonely make your words
[02:29.67]
[02:30.21]I'm tired I can't take it any more
[02:33.31]
[02:35.29]Those three empty words
[02:37.01]
[02:37.63]Will lonely make your words
[02:39.60]
[02:40.19]We're tired we can't take it any more
[02:43.14]
[02:44.21]We're going through the motions
[02:46.27]
[02:49.02]'Cos we can't fix what's broken
[02:51.56]
[02:54.79]And I know it's gonna hurt
[02:57.08]
[02:57.77]But darling I'll go first
[02:59.70]
[03:00.38]I won't keep on saying those three empty words
[03:04.92]We don't have to keep on saying those three empty words
[03:09.66]
