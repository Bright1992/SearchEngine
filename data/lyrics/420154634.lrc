[00:08.25]You say it's not supposed to be
[00:14.86]Tell me not to waste my time
[00:18.83]This was never up to me
[00:22.86]But if it was I wouldn't mind
[00:28.22]And I'm trying to ignore you
[00:33.16]I try to go on with my day, hey
[00:37.81]But I still pick up the phone, yeah
[00:41.75]And get lost in what she say
[00:47.05]I can try to stop it, all I like
[00:51.99]Hands down I've lost this fight
[00:55.88]Thought I was strong enough for you
[01:00.98]But I just can't hide the truth
[01:04.65]So I guess I'm going down
[01:09.36]I guess I'm going down like this
[01:19.39]And I love it how she's honest

[01:29.38]She's not even drop dead gorgeous
[01:33.22]But she kills me anyway, oh
[01:38.19]I can try to stop it, all I like
[01:43.37]Hands down I've lost this fight

[02:05.72]I guess I'm going down like this
[02:15.01]I can try to stop it, all I like
[02:20.97]Hands down I've lost this fight
[02:25.32]Thought I was strong enough for you
[02:30.07]But I just can't hide the truth
[02:33.96]I can try to stop it, all I like
[02:39.25]Hands down I've lost this fight
[02:43.29]And I thought I was strong enough for you
[02:48.30]But I just can't hide the truth
[02:52.08]So I guess I'm going down like this
