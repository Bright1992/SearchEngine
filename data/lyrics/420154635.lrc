[00:10.25]Staring at my hotel window
[00:14.85]Too much on my mind
[00:19.65]Maybe we should keep it simple
[00:24.24]We don't have to decide
[00:27.46]We don't need to overcomplicate it
[00:32.32]Cause I've been here once before don't even say it
[00:36.05]
[00:36.83]Baby please no promises
[00:41.23]Cause we won't keep our promises
[00:45.98]And I know the consequences
[00:50.76]So baby please, baby please no promises
[00:56.02]
[00:56.86]I've never been a fan of heartbreak
[01:01.82]So tell me what you want
[01:06.38]Take my hands across your body
[01:11.21]We don't have to hold on
[01:14.57]We don't need to overcomplicate it
[01:19.24]Cause I've been here once before don't even say it
[01:23.14]
[01:23.90]Baby please no promises
[01:28.30]Cause we won't keep our promises
[01:32.96]And I know the consequences
[01:37.70]So baby please, baby please no promises
[01:42.81]
[01:42.88]Cause I've been living only for this moment
[01:47.63]And I don't wanna let it slip away
[01:52.36]I've been living only for this moment
[01:57.20]And I don't know how much that I can take
[02:00.75]
[02:04.00]Baby please no promises
[02:08.38]Cause we won't keep our promises
[02:12.95]And I know the consequences
[02:17.72]So baby please, baby please no promises
[02:23.16]
[02:24.41]Yeah baby please no promises
[02:29.72]Baby please no promises
