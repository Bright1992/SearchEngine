[00:10.68]Am I asking all these questions for nothing
[00:18.45]I'm wondering if anyone's there
[00:24.92]I really need to make a confession
[00:30.17]I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared
[00:35.97]Cause I've been on this train too long
[00:39.85]People gettin' off and on
[00:42.87]I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belong
[00:48.01]And every time I ask myself
[00:51.85]Am I turnin' into someone else?
[00:54.63]I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am
[00:59.79]I really wanna understand
[01:05.25]I just wanna understand
[01:13.06]I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah
[01:19.02]To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
[01:25.63]It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
[01:31.48]But it's good to know that somebody cares
[01:37.52]Cause I've been on this train too long
[01:40.39]People gettin' off and on
[01:43.36]I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belong
[01:48.12]And every time I ask myself
[01:52.27]Am I turnin' into someone else?
[01:55.52]I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am
[02:00.20]I really wanna understand
[02:05.94]I just wanna understand
[02:13.84]'Cause we all get lost sometimes, yeah
[02:20.65]Yeah we all get lost sometimes
[02:26.09]We don't leave your heart behind
[02:31.53]'Cause we all get lost sometimes
[02:36.44]I really wanna understand
[02:42.61]But I just gotta understand
[02:48.82]Now I just need to, I need to understand
[02:54.85]I really wanna understand, ohh who I am
[03:08.07]When you wake up your whole world's flipped
[03:11.08]It's just different, and you gotta, you know you gotta, you gotta go with it
[03:14.82]And that's just simply growing up
[03:17.91]And not see it in a negative way
[03:21.76]If they see it as it has been given to you
[03:24.96]I mean, as much as time can be crazy
[03:27.66]You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be
[03:31.23]You're not going to feel out of place anymore
[03:34.30]You're going to feel like that's where you meant to be
[03:37.66]You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
[03:41.85]You just let it go, and, and grow with it
[03:44.27]And you can't hold on to the old you, or the old this, or the old that
[03:47.28]Because you know you change, and it's not changing in a bad way
[03:51.61]It's just changing because that' what happens life
[03:53.82]You grow up, everyone moves on
[03:56.79]You're just learning
[03:58.40]You stay true to yourself
[04:01.39]Changing isn't a bad thing
[04:04.62]It never was
[04:05.23]But at the end of the day, you know
[04:08.64]You're the same person
[04:10.11]And, and where your heart is
[04:13.43]That doesn't change
[04:16.46]And everytime I ask myself
[04:19.49]Am I turning into someone else?
[04:22.68]And I just really got I'm still who I am
[04:27.34]I really wanna understand
[04:33.18]I just need to understand, yeah
[04:39.00]Now I just need to, I need to understand
[04:45.19]I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am
