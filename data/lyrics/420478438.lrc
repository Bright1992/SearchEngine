[00:01.16]We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
[00:05.82]We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[00:10.64]We don't laugh anymore
[00:13.04]What was all of it for?
[00:15.65]Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[00:20.07]I just heard you found the one you been looking
[00:23.70]You been looking for
[00:26.20]I wish I would have known that wasn't me
[00:29.99]Cause even after all this time I still wonder
[00:33.41]Why I can't move on
[00:35.78]Just the way you did so easily
[00:39.42]Don't wanna know
[00:41.91]Kinda dress you're wearing tonight
[00:43.60]If he's holding onto you so tight
[00:46.03]The way I did before
[00:48.31]I overdosed
[00:51.37]Should've known your love was a game
[00:53.43]Now I can't get you out of my brain

[01:36.15]I just hope you're lying next to somebody
[01:40.00]Who knows how to love you like me
[01:42.91]There must be a good reason that you're gone
[01:46.65]Every now and then I think you might want me to
[01:50.18]Come show up at your door
[01:52.34]But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
[01:56.48]Don't wanna know
[01:58.34]If you're looking into her eyes
[02:00.95]If she's holding onto you so tight
[02:03.01]The way I did before
[02:06.17]I overdosed
[02:08.13]Should've known your love was a game
[02:10.09]Now I can't get you out of my brain
[02:12.31]Oh, it's such a shame
[02:15.83]That we don't talk anymore (We don't we don't)
[02:17.74]We don't talk anymore (We don't we don't)
[02:20.00]We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[02:24.92]We don't laugh anymore (We don't we don't)
[02:27.21]What was all of it for? (We don't we don't)
