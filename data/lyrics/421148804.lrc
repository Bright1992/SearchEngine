[00:35.23]We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
[00:39.56]We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[00:44.28]We don't love anymore
[00:46.34]What was all of it for?
[00:48.00]Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[00:53.33]
[00:53.43]I just heard you found the one you've been looking
[00:56.88]You've been looking for
[00:59.00]I wish I would have known that wasn't me
[01:02.35]Cause even after all this time I still wonder
[01:05.86]Why I can't move on
[01:08.07]Just the way you did so easily
[01:11.88]
[01:12.18]Don't wanna know
[01:13.53]What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
[01:15.97]If he's holding onto you so tight
[01:18.33]The way I did before
[01:20.84]I overdosed
[01:22.64]Should've known your love was a game
[01:25.11]Now I can't get you out of my brain
[01:27.47]Oh, it's such a shame
[01:30.10]

[01:48.42]I just hope you're lying next to somebody
[01:51.22]Who knows how to love you like me
[01:53.67]There must be a good reason that you're gone
[01:57.35]Every now and then I think you
[01:59.26]Might want me to come show up at your door
[02:02.92]But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
[02:06.63]
[02:06.84]Don't wanna know
[02:08.39]If you're looking into her eyes
[02:10.55]If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
[02:15.61]I overdosed
