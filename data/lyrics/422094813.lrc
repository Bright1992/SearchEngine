[00:12.160]If all I had was a dollar and your bright smile
[00:15.030]I'd have a dollar more than I would need to get by
[00:17.700]Cause I'm a billionaire if you count every sunrise
[00:20.930]Waking by your side, and every good night
[00:24.020]If all you had was the way that I love you
[00:27.000]You'd have more honey than the honey bees in June

[00:32.970]Long as I have you, nothing we can't do
[00:35.750]Fly me back to the moon where you took me
[00:40.070]The very first time that you kissed me
[00:42.950]In the sweet starlight of your endless eyes when you lit this fire
[00:47.700]Feels like we're sitting on top of a goldmine
[00:52.140]Flame so bright that it won't die
[00:55.010]In a billion years it'll still be here cause our love is a goldmine
[01:03.970]Yeah, our love is a goldmine
[01:12.040]If everything we ever owned disappeared today
[01:15.170]We'd build a castle in the sand somewhere far away
[01:17.820]Don't need no money, no TV, don't need no microwave
[01:20.860]Just the ocean waves, and the love we make
[01:23.810]Fly me back to the moon where you took me
[01:27.940]The very first time that you kissed me
[01:30.900]In the sweet starlight of your endless eyes when you lit this fire

[01:39.910]Flame so bright that it won't die
[01:42.820]In a billion years it'll still be here cause our love is a goldmine
[01:59.990]We'll be rich in wrinkles, old and gray
[02:05.910]When the rising tide sweeps us away
[02:10.980]Until then...
[02:11.880]Fly me back to the moon where you took me
[02:16.030]The very first time that you kissed me
[02:18.920]In the sweet starlight of your endless eyes when you lit this fire
[02:23.500]Feels like we're sitting on top of a goldmine
