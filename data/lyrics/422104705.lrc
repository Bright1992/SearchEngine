[00:58]Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
[01:02]Our song on the radio but it don´t sound the same
[01:07]When our friends talk about you
[01:09]All that it does is just tear me down
[01:12]Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
[01:16]And it all just sound like uh uh uh
[01:21]Hmmm too young too dumb to realize
[01:25]That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
[01:30]Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance
[01:35]Take you to every party
[01:37]Cause all you wanted to do was dance
[01:40]Now my baby is dancing
[01:42]But she´s dancing with another man
[01:48]My pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways
[01:52]Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
[01:58]Now I never never get to clean up the mess I made
[02:04]And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
[02:06]It all just sounds like uh uh uh uh
[02:11]Uh Too young too dumb to realize
[02:15]That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
[02:19]Should have gave all my hours when I had the chance
[02:25]Take you to every party
[02:27]Cause all you wanted to do was dance
[02:30]Now my baby is dancing
[02:32]But she´s dancing with another man
