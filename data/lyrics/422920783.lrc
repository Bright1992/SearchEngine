[00:12.67]You were the shadow to my light
[00:15.32]Did you feel us
[00:18.64]Another start
[00:20.27]You fade away
[00:22.24]Afraid our aim is out of sight
[00:24.83]Wanna see us
[00:28.70]Alive
[00:30.53]Where are you now
[00:35.23]Where are you now
[00:40.10]Where are you now
[00:42.43]Was it all in my fantasy
[00:44.81]Where are you now
[00:47.36]Were you only imaginary
[00:50.79]Where are you now
[00:53.70]Atlantis
[00:55.45]Under the sea
[00:57.77]Under the sea
[01:00.19]Where are you now
[01:02.56]Another dream
[01:05.49]The monsters running wild inside of me
[01:09.00]I'm faded
[01:17.35]So lost
[01:18.66]I'm faded
[01:23.67]I'm faded
[01:26.77]So lost
[01:28.18]I'm faded
[01:30.80]These shallow waters, never met
[01:32.60]What I needed
[01:35.85]I'm letting go
[01:37.47]A deeper dive
[01:39.36]Eternal silence of the sea
[01:42.22]I'm breathing
[01:45.26]Alive
[01:47.68]Where are you now
[01:52.41]Where are you now
[01:57.18]Under the bright
[01:58.29]But faded lights
[01:59.67]You set my heart on fire
[02:01.91]Where are you now
[02:04.35]Where are you now
[02:07.96]Where are you now
[02:10.82]Atlantis
[02:12.64]Under the sea
[02:14.94]Under the sea
[02:17.36]Where are you now
[02:19.79]Another dream
[02:22.70]The monsters running wild inside of me
[02:26.24]I'm faded
[02:34.50]So lost
[02:35.80]I'm faded
[02:40.79]I'm faded
[02:44.40]So lost
[02:45.40]I'm faded
[02:50.22]I'm faded
[02:53.63]So lost
[02:54.82]I'm faded
[02:59.71]I'm faded
[03:03.00]So lost
[03:04.40]I'm faded
