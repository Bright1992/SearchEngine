[00:12.710] You and me we made a vow
[00:19.400] For better or for worse
[00:24.920] I can't believe you let me down
[00:29.600] But the proof's in the way it hurts
[00:36.780] For months on end I've had my doubts
[00:42.310] Denying every tear
[00:48.500] I wish this would be over now
[00:52.640] But I know that I still need you here
[00:58.730] You say I'm crazy
[01:04.040] Cuz you don't think I know what you've done
[01:09.910] But when you call me baby
[01:16.550] I know I'm not the only one
[01:21.790] But you say I'm crazy
[01:28.080] Cos you don't think I know what you've done
[01:32.860] But when you call me baby
[01:39.950] I know I'm not the only one
[01:59.600] You've been so unavailable
[02:03.560] Now sadly I know why
[02:10.300] Your heart is unobtainable
[02:15.430] Even though Lord knows you kept mine
[02:21.710] I have loved you for many years
[02:26.450] Maybe I am just not enough
[02:32.140] You've made me realise my deepest fear
[02:37.980] By lying and tearing us up
[02:43.820] But you say I'm crazy
[02:49.640] Cuz you don't think I know what you've done
[02:55.460] But when you call me baby
[03:02.060] I know I'm not the only one
[03:07.350] But you say I'm crazy
[03:14.240] Cuz you don't think I know what you've done
[03:19.560] But when you call me baby
[03:26.330] I know I'm not the only one
[03:31.190] You say I'm crazy
[03:37.950] Cos you don't think I know what you've done
[03:42.870] But when you call me baby
[03:49.640] I know I'm not the only one
