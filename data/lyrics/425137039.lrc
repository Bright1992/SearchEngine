[00:01.75]I remember when we broke up, the first time
[00:04.85]Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," cause like
[00:07.27]We hadn't seen each other in a month
[00:09.09]When you said you needed space. What?
[00:12.05]Then you come around again and say
[00:14.21]"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change. Trust me"
[00:17.43]Remember how that lasted for a day?
[00:19.35]I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"
[00:22.69]Ooh we called it off again last night
[00:27.56]But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
[00:33.01]We are never ever ever getting back together
[00:38.00]We are never ever ever getting back together
[00:43.30]You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
[00:48.00]But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
[00:57.89]I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me
[01:00.38]Falling for it screaming that I'm right and you
[01:03.46]Would hide away and find your piece of mind
[01:05.23]With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
[01:08.24]Oh, excuse me?
[01:09.16]Ooh, you called me up again tonight
[01:13.55]But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
[01:19.00]We are never ever ever getting back together
[01:24.00]We are never ever ever getting back together
[01:29.00]You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
[01:33.70]But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
[01:40.94]Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh!
[01:49.63]I used to think that we were forever ever
[01:54.36]And I used to say, "Never say never"
[02:00.00]So she's all like,
[02:02.00]"Charlie, you need to come over to my house now"
[02:04.16]"because you need to get your Dave Matthews CDs"
[02:06.17]And I'm like, well
[02:08.00]"I don't even listen to Dave Matthews!"
[02:10.10]We are never ever ever getting back together
[02:15.00]We are never ever ever getting back together
[02:20.06]You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
[02:24.95]But we are never ever ever ever
[02:30.07]We are never ever ever getting back together
[02:35.34]We are never ever ever getting back together
[02:40.37]You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
[02:45.17]But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
[02:52.43]
