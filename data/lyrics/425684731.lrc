[00:03.120]Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
[00:08.340]What else can we do when we're feeling low?
[00:13.480]So take a deep breath and let it go
[00:18.590]You shouldn't be drowning on your own
[00:22.400]And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
[00:27.770]Into cold, cold water for you
[00:32.660]And although time may take us into different places
[00:38.130]I will still be patient with you
[00:42.790]And I hope you know
[00:45.390]I won't let go
[00:50.670]I'll be your lifeline tonight
[00:56.060]I won't let go
[01:01.220]I'll be your lifeline tonight
[01:07.360]Neck and wrist water
[01:08.430]Frozen, cold water
[01:09.710]Your ex went hard but Gucci go harder
[01:12.300]You say he do it big but Gucci went larger
[01:14.830]I just want to spoil ya, escape to Florida
[01:17.470]Charter us a plane and fly away from Georgia
[01:20.000]Have you been to Spain? Let's tour Barcelona
[01:22.430]Put you in LA like Prince did Apollonia
[01:25.070]Please don't wear that dress you wore last time, I wanted ya
[01:27.710]300,000 dollars on one ring I taunt ya
[01:30.200]You never get me after one night, I hunt ya
[01:32.760]Cause the stick got power, it can go for hours
[01:35.240]Cause this chick so bad, make you take a cold shower
[01:37.730]And although time may take us into different places
[01:42.290]I will still be patient with you
[01:47.360]And I hope you know
[01:49.800]I won't let go (I won't let go, no no, no more)
[01:55.450]I'll be your lifeline tonight
[02:00.490]I won't let go
[02:05.660]I'll be your lifeline tonight
[02:11.760]Come on, come on
[02:12.970]Save me from my rocking boat
[02:15.600]I just wanna stay afloat
[02:18.360]I'm all alone
[02:21.750]And I hope, I hope someone's gonna take me home
[02:25.720]Somewhere I can rest my soul
[02:28.670]I need to know you won't let go
[02:33.580]I won't let go, no no, no no no no
[02:36.760]I'll be your lifeline tonight
[02:41.680]You won't let go
[02:46.910]I'll be your lifeline tonight
[02:51.820]I won't let go
[02:57.260]I won't let go
