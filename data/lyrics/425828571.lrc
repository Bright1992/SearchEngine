[00:29.88]Summer in the hills
[00:33.11]Those hazy days I do remember
[00:37.00]We were running still
[00:40.26]Had the whole world at our feet
[00:44.53]Watching seasons change
[00:47.79]Our roads were lined with adventure
[00:52.06]Mountains in the way
[00:55.32]Couldn't keep us from the sea
[00:58.83]
[00:58.83]Here we stand open arms
[01:02.39]This is home where we are
[01:05.90]Ever strong in the world that we made
[01:13.43]I still hear you in the breeze
[01:17.45]See your shadows in the trees
[01:20.96]Holding on, memories never change
[01:28.99]
