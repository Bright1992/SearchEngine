[00:10.65]I won't lie to you
[00:15.16]I know he's just not right for you
[00:20.46]And you can tell me if I'm off
[00:21.94]But I see it on your face
[00:23.23]When you say that he's the one that you want
[00:25.78]And you're spending all your time
[00:27.10]In this wrong situation
[00:28.54]And anytime you want it to stop
[00:30.70]I know I can treat you better
[00:34.17]Than he can
[00:35.69]And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
[00:40.78]Tell me why are we wasting time
[00:42.45]And all on your wasted cring
[00:43.72]When you should be with me instead
[00:46.18]I know I can treat you better
[00:50.60]Better than he can
[01:01.10]Better than he can
[01:11.32]Better than he can
[01:17.75]I'll stop time for you
[01:22.18]The second you say you'd like me to
[01:28.70]I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
[01:30.66]Baby, just to wake up with you
[01:32.88]Would be everything I need and this could be so different
[01:35.76]Tell me what you want to do
[01:37.63]Cause I know I can treat you better
[01:41.27]Than he can
[01:42.80]And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
[01:47.91]Tell me why are we wasting time
[01:49.47]And all on your wasted cring
[01:50.73]When you should be with me instead
[01:53.26]I know I can treat you better
[01:57.67]Better than he can
[02:08.60]Better than he can

[02:26.96]Take my hand, we'll be fine
[02:30.20]Promise I won't let you down
[02:34.79]Just know that you don't
[02:37.29]Have to do this alone
[02:40.36]Promise I'll never let you down
[02:44.71]Cause I know I can treat you better
[02:48.42]Than he can
[02:49.88]And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
