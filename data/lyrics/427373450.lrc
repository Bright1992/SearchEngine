[00:05.10]Summer in the hills
[00:08.00]Those hazy days I do remember
[00:11.90]We were running still
[00:14.940]Had the whole world at our feet
[00:18.590]Watching seasons change
[00:21.40]Our roads were lined with adventure
[00:25.20]Mountains in the way
[00:27.90]Couldn't keep us from the sea
[00:31.20]Here we stand open arms
[00:34.30]This is home where we are
[00:37.60]Ever strong in the world that we made
[00:41.150]I still hear you in the breeze
[00:47.80]See your shadows in the trees
[00:51.00]Holding on, memories never change
[02:05.20]Here we stand open arms
[02:08.80]This is home where we are
[02:11.90]Ever strong in the world that we made
[02:18.70]I still hear you in the breeze
[02:21.90]See your shadows in the trees
[02:25.30]Holding on, memories never change
