[00:25.52]
[00:26.00]Beautiful mind
[00:27.56]Your heart got a story with mine
[00:30.12]Your heart got me hurting at times

[00:45.31]It took us a while
[00:47.89]With every breath a new day
[00:50.38]With love on the line
[00:52.80]We've had our share of mistakes
[00:56.10]But all your flaws and scars are mine
[01:00.38]Still falling for you

[01:52.79]Still falling for you
[01:54.64]
[01:55.27]It took us a while
[01:57.78]Because we were young and unsure
[02:00.32]With love on the line
[02:02.78]What if we both would need more
