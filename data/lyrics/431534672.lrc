[00:07.94]I got this feeling inside my bones
[00:12.23]It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
[00:16.44]And if you want it inside your soul
[00:20.67]Just open up your heart let music take control
[00:23.73]
[00:24.38]I got that sunshine in my pocket
[00:27.35]Got that good soul in my feet
[00:29.40]I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
[00:33.77]I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
[00:37.97]Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
[00:41.10]
[00:41.35]And under the lights when everything goes
[00:46.19]Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
[00:50.48]When we move, well, you already know
[00:54.85]So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
[00:58.67]
[00:59.73]Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
[01:03.35]A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
[01:05.74]So just dance, dance, dance, come on
[01:08.20]All those things I shouldn't do
[01:09.96]But you dance, dance, dance
[01:12.00]And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
[01:15.91]I can't stop the feeling
[01:18.47]So just dance, dance, dance
[01:20.11]I can't stop the feeling
[01:22.74]So just dance, dance, dance, come on
[01:24.64]
[01:25.53]Ooh, it's something magical
[01:28.67]It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
[01:32.91]I don't need no reason, don't need control
[01:37.14]I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
[01:40.30]
[01:40.93]Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
[01:43.76]Got that good soul in my feet
[01:45.85]I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
[01:50.18]I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
[01:54.40]Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
[01:57.24]
