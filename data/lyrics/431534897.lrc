[00:00.36]You with the sad eyes
[00:06.50]Don't be discouraged, oh I realize
[00:17.31]It's hard to take courage
[00:20.42]In a world full of people
[00:24.25]You can lose sight of it all
[00:27.44]The darkness inside you
[00:29.94]Can make you feel so small
[00:33.52]
[00:51.30]Show me a smile then
[00:56.20]Don't be unhappy
[00:58.80]Can't remember when
[01:02.70]I last saw you laughing
[01:05.81]This world makes you crazy
[01:09.21]And you've taken all you can bear
[01:12.51]Just, call me up
[01:15.30]'Cause I will always be there
[01:18.30]
[01:18.42]And I see your true colors
[01:22.73]Shining through
[01:25.19]I see your true colors
[01:29.72]And that's why I love you
[01:32.94]
[01:36.32]So don't be afraid to let them show
[01:42.59]Your true colors
[01:46.27]True colors are beautiful
[01:54.74]I see your true colors
[01:58.82]Shining through (true colors)
[02:01.28]I see your true colors
[02:05.49]And that's why I love you
[02:08.72]So don't be afraid to let them show
[02:14.94]Your true colors
[02:18.60]True colors are beautiful
[02:27.57]Like a rainbow
[02:31.65]Oooooh oooooh oooh like a rainbow
