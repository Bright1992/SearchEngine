[00:38.54]What if we were sixteen again?
[00:40.81]Parties never had to end
[00:43.04]Life was always like a vacation
[00:47.45]Building castles in the sand
[00:49.75]Showing off why we were stand
[00:51.94]All day long be cruisin' naked
[00:56.16]And in the summer vibe
[00:59.97]
[00:60.00]We'd be cruisin'
[01:05.73]We ain't got nowhere to go
[01:07.78]Only thing we know is
[01:09.51]We're cruisin'
[01:14.68]Running free on our night time
[01:16.74]Every day and night
[01:18.27]We'd be cruisin'
[01:22.68]We'd be cruisin'
[01:26.23]
[01:28.15]Cannonballs into the sea
[01:30.09]Everything is make believe
[01:32.34]Carousel in underneath rainbows
[01:36.82]We're swinging from tree to tree
[01:38.99]Ever after happily
[01:41.36]Frolicking wherever the sun goes
[01:45.35]And in the summer vibe
[01:49.50]
[01:49.51]We'd be cruisin'
[01:55.16]We ain't got nowhere to go
[01:57.39]Only thing we know is
[01:58.71]We're cruisin'
[02:04.10]Running free on our night time
[02:06.38]Every day and night
[02:07.45]We'd be cruisin'
[02:11.95]We'd be cruisin'
[02:15.49]
[02:16.88]Take the stars and never let
[02:21.53]Get lost and don't come back again
[02:25.30]You'll be cruisin'
[02:31.05]We ain't got nowhere to go
[02:33.00]Only thing we know is
[02:34.74]We're cruisin'
[02:39.97]Running free on our night time
[02:42.05]Every day and night
[02:43.44]We'd be cruisin'
[02:48.98]We ain't got nowhere to go
[02:51.14]Only thing we know is
[02:52.52]We're cruisin'
[02:57.95]Running free on our night time
[03:00.14]Every day and night
[03:01.22]We'd be cruisin'
[03:05.87]We'd be cruisin'
[03:10.28]We'd be cruisin'
