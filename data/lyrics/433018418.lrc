[00:20.04]Uhmm uhmm uhmm
[00:31.03]There's burning in your eyes
[00:35.06]Craving I can't hide
[00:38.96]That's raging through the heart of me
[00:42.25]Just like a wild fire
[00:46.65]I wanna touch the sparks
[00:50.20]But I'm safer in the dark
[00:54.34]I'm scared to see what happens
[00:57.43]If we let it go too far
[01:02.38]I don't wanna miss you
[01:04.34]I don't wanna wish you
[01:06.15]Always fall around every time I'm without you
[01:09.93]I don't wanna see you inside every dream
[01:13.31]You're never gonna make come true
[01:16.67]I don't wanna love you
[01:24.43]I don't wanna love you
[01:32.43]But I do
[01:40.61]Is the pleasure worth the pain
[01:44.58]The sunlight worth the rain
[01:48.43]The silence worth the sound of our hearts
[01:52.43]Screaming while they break
[01:56.02]Is surrender worth the fight
[01:59.86]When the battle leaves you blind
[02:03.99]And if you never see me
[02:06.92]Will I still be on your mind
[02:11.85]I don't wanna miss you
[02:13.85]I don't wanna wish you
[02:15.79]Always fall around every time I'm without you
[02:19.56]I don't wanna see you inside every dream
[02:23.02]You're never gonna make come true
[02:26.22]I don't wanna love you
[02:34.14]I don't wanna love you
[02:42.30]But I do
[02:49.72]But I do
[02:57.88]No I don't wanna miss you
[03:00.31]I don't wanna wish you
[03:02.24]Always fall around every time I'm without you
[03:06.10]I don't wanna see you inside every dream
[03:09.50]You're never gonna make come true
[03:12.67]I don't wanna love you
[03:20.59]I don't wanna love you
[03:28.25]I don't wanna love you
[03:36.11]But I do
[03:43.87]But I do
