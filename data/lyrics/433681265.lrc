[01:28.64]I'm a gypsy heart
[01:30.35]I'm a gypsy heart
[01:52.58]It's a sunny day on the golden coast
[01:55.84]I'm a dream away and I'm good to go
[01:59.46]Got a zepplin' groove on the stereo
[02:02.89]And the song that is on is the sound of my soul
[02:06.27]I'm a gypsy heart we were backed upon
[02:09.85]Anywhere we are is where we belong
[02:13.21]But you're far away and it's been too long
[02:16.68]So I go where I'm going I never know
[02:20.23]But
[02:20.53]I can't wait

[02:40.77]I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart
[02:44.39]As long as it's takin' me to ya
[02:54.61]So I take a breath
[02:56.47]and I close my eyes
[02:58.08]Now I see your face
[02:59.74]and I start to smile
[03:01.50]I'm a singing bird in an open sky
[03:04.96]So I fly and I fly
[03:07.20]'til I get real high
[03:08.25]Oh
[03:08.91]I can't wait to get back out on the road
[03:12.38]Counting every mile
[03:13.68]'til I get where I'm going

[03:25.70]I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart
[03:29.11]I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart
[03:32.73]As long as it's takin' me to ya
[03:36.30]If I'm in your arms
[03:37.80]I can dream all day
[03:39.42]If there's clouds in the sky
[03:41.27]we can wish them away
[03:42.93]'cause I need you right now
[03:44.77]and I don't wanna wait
[03:46.37]So I walk 'til I run
[03:48.08]and I run 'til I fly
[03:49.89]'cause
[03:50.19]I can't wait to get back out on the road
[03:53.66]I'm counting every mile
[03:55.11]'til I get where I'm going
[03:57.13]I don't even care
[03:58.53]if it's fast or it's slow
[04:00.60]As long as it's taking me to ya
[04:03.87]Oh I can't wait to get back
[04:06.08]out on the road
[04:07.49]I'm counting every mile
[04:08.95]'til I get where I'm going
[04:10.90]I don't even care
[04:12.31]if it's fast or it's slow
[04:14.32]As long as it's taking me to ya
[04:17.59]I'm a gyy-yyy-psy heart
