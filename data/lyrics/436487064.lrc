[00:14.040]Came down the mountain
[00:15.240]
[00:16.210]Draggin' our love affair
[00:17.610]
[00:18.980]Put on a pretty little number
[00:20.330]I'm wearing you still
[00:21.790]
[00:24.300]It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
[00:28.810]
[00:29.570]Nobody saw it coming but the little red devil in me
[00:33.320]
[00:34.790]He has a funny way saying forever too fast
[00:38.630]
[00:39.830]Don't get mad can't blame a tramp
[00:42.030]For something he don't have
[00:43.250]
[00:44.230]I get on my knees and beg you
[00:46.750]
[00:47.480]Hear my sinner's prayer
[00:49.010]
[00:50.130]I am what I am
[00:51.600]
[00:52.620]And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
[00:55.540]But you but you
[00:56.920]
[00:57.890]Hear my sinner's prayer
[00:59.490]
[01:00.360]It's the only one I know
[01:01.970]
[01:02.960]It sure as hell don't rhyme
[01:04.690]But it's as good as good as good as good as gold
[01:07.870]
[01:19.000]Got a baby sister who looks just like me
[01:22.920]
[01:23.790]She wants nothing more than a man to please
[01:26.810]
[01:29.360]Maybe she's in too deep
[01:30.680]
[01:31.440]Her love for him ain't cheap
[01:33.200]
[01:33.920]But it breaks just like a knockoff piece
[01:37.310]From Fulton street
[01:38.420]
[01:39.850]The man's got a gift for getting what he wants
[01:43.540]
[01:44.950]He's thirsty when he drinks
[01:46.320]Gets on the brink and throws her off
[01:49.120]I get on my knees and beg you
[01:51.610]
[01:52.460]Hear my sinner's prayer
[01:53.970]
[01:55.230]I am what I am
[01:56.610]
[01:57.560]And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
[02:00.780]But you but you
[02:01.750]
[02:02.910]Hear my sinner's prayer
[02:04.440]
[02:05.350]It's the only one I know
[02:07.000]
[02:07.940]It sure as hell don't rhyme
[02:09.680]But it's as good as good as good as good as gold
[02:13.010]
[02:15.190]Good as good as good as good as gold
[02:18.640]
[02:22.910]I can carry you but not your ghosts
[02:29.990]
[02:33.420]Wish I had the faith but I don't know oh
[02:42.910]
[02:44.710]Hear my sinner's prayer
[02:46.140]
[02:47.300]I am what I am
[02:48.840]
[02:49.790]And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
[02:52.840]But you but you
[02:54.000]
[02:55.060]Hear my sinner's prayer
[02:56.690]
[02:57.590]Only one I know
[02:59.230]
[03:00.100]It sure as hell don't rhyme
[03:01.940]But it's as good as good as good as good as gold
[03:05.450]
[03:07.300]Good as good as good as good as gold
[03:10.520]
[03:12.460]Good as good as good as gold
[03:15.540]
[03:17.550]Good as good as good as good as gold
[03:20.680]
[03:22.700]Good as good as good as good as gold
