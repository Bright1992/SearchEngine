[00:14.200]I confess I am lost
[00:17.990]In the age of the social
[00:21.220]
[00:21.750]On our knees take a test
[00:25.560]To be lovin' and grateful
[00:29.310]Shots were fired on the street
[00:32.620]
[00:33.130]By the church where we used to meet
[00:36.180]
[00:36.970]Angel down angel down
[00:40.110]
[00:40.750]But the people just stood around
[00:43.790]
[00:46.510]I'm a believer it's a trial
[00:50.230]Foolish and weaker oh oh oh
[00:53.490]
[00:54.170]I'd rather save an angel down
[00:58.630]
[00:59.830]I'm a believer it's chaos
[01:03.130]
[01:03.640]Where are our leaders oh oh oh
[01:07.570]I'd rather save an angel down
[01:10.820]
[01:13.340]Doesn't everyone belong
[01:16.270]
[01:17.020]In the arms of the sacred
[01:20.830]Why do we pretend we're wrong
[01:24.010]
[01:24.630]Has our young courage faded
[01:27.830]
[01:28.330]Shots were fired on the street
[01:31.660]
[01:32.200]By the church where we used to meet
[01:35.290]
[01:36.080]Angel down angel down
[01:39.150]
[01:39.870]Why do people just stand around
[01:43.700]
[01:45.620]I'm a believer it's a trial
[01:49.290]Foolish and weaker oh oh oh
