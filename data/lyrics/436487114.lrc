[00:13.23]Clipped wings, I was a broken thing
[00:15.91]Had a voice, had a voice but I could not sing
[00:18.70]You would wind me down
[00:21.79]I struggled on the ground
[00:26.02]So lost, the line had been crossed
[00:28.55]Had a voice, had a voice but I could not talk
[00:32.39]You held me down
[00:34.18]I struggle to fly now
[00:36.98]
[00:37.42]Oh, but there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
[00:44.20]We hold on so tight, we cannot deny
[00:46.99]Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive
[00:53.53]Oh, yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
[00:55.49]We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no
[00:58.77]I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
[01:02.50]
[01:03.75]And I don't care if I sing off key
[01:06.33]I found myself in my melodies
[01:09.33]I sing for love, I sing for me
[01:12.52]I shout it out like a bird set free
[01:16.15]No I don't care if I sing off key
[01:18.98]I found myself in my melodies
[01:22.27]I sing for love, I sing for me
[01:25.31]I'll shout it out like a bird set free
[01:38.49]I'll shout it out like a bird set free
[01:51.19]I'll shout it out like a bird set free
[01:53.98]
[01:55.37]Now I fly, hit the high notes
[01:58.46]I have a voice, have a voice, hear me roar tonight
[02:00.95]You held me down
[02:03.73]But I fought back loud
[02:06.48]Oh, cause there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
[02:11.66]We hold on so tight, but we cannot deny
[02:14.05]Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive
[02:19.12]Oh, yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
[02:24.30]We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no
[02:27.28]I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die yeah
[02:32.66]
[02:32.91]And I don't care if I sing off key
[02:35.40]I found myself in my melodies
[02:38.54]I sing for love, I sing for me
[02:41.73]I shout it out like a bird set free

[03:07.90]I'll shout it out like a bird set free

[03:33.88]I'll shout it out like a bird set free
[03:46.58]I'll shout it out like a bird set free
[03:59.33]I'll shout it out like a bird set free
