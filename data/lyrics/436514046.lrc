[00:10.950]I love seeing you happy
[00:13.420]I miss seeing that smile
[00:16.000]It's been such a long time
[00:21.100]And although I don't have you
[00:23.480]I know now that I need to
[00:26.500]And somehow make you mine
[00:29.560]And I won't lie, It's hard seeing you with him
[00:33.900]'Cause I know he can't hold you like I can
[00:38.460]
[00:40.360]Someday maybe when we're old and gray
[00:45.440]We could be in love once more
[00:50.470]Till then I won't give my love away
[00:54.920]Darling, I'm forever only yours
[00:59.240]
[01:01.520]I remember that love song
[01:04.400]I sang every word wrong
[01:06.810]But you didn't mind, no no
[01:11.530]And I'll admit that I miss you
[01:14.400]But only if you do
[01:16.700]'Cause you know that I'm shy
[01:20.600]And I can't lie, it's hard seeing you with her
[01:24.480]'Cause I know she can't love you like I can
[01:29.250]
[01:30.860]Someday maybe when we're old and gray
[01:36.000]We could be in love once more
[01:41.200]Till then I won't give my love away
[01:45.430]Darling, I'm forever only yours
[01:49.510]
[01:51.380]And my love then what's for you then (it works for you)
[01:53.890]We got nothing to lose
[01:55.940]'Cause I'm forever only yours (in love once more, once more, once more)
[02:01.480]Not need to complicate it
[02:04.700]That smile is worth the wait, yeah
[02:06.310]I'm forever only yours (hey, yeah)
[02:11.660]Someday maybe
[02:14.200]Someday maybe
[02:16.700]Someday maybe
[02:18.310]I'll be yours (woah, baby)
[02:21.790]Someday maybe (someday maybe)
[02:24.230]Someday maybe (someday maybe)
[02:26.760]Someday maybe (someday maybe)
[02:28.290]I'll be yours (someday maybe I'll be yours)
[02:31.520]
[02:31.540]Someday maybe when we're old and gray
[02:36.590]We could be in love once more
[02:41.610]Till then I won't give my love away
[02:46.500]Darling, I'm forever only yours
[02:50.300]
[02:51.970]And my love then what's for you then
[02:54.650]We got nothing to lose
[02:56.430]'Cause I'm forever only yours (someday I'll be yours)
[03:02.150]Not need to complicate it
[03:04.710]That smile is worth the wait, yeah
[03:06.890]I'm forever yours (someday maybe I'll be yours)
[03:11.260]I said know, I'm forever only yours
