[00:16.250]There are moments that the words don't reach
[00:19.910]There is suffering too terrible to name
[00:23.550]You hold your child as tight as you can
[00:27.620]Then push away the unimaginable
[00:31.630]The moments when you're in so deep
[00:34.810]Feels easier to just swim down
[00:39.390]And so they move uptown
[00:42.120]And learn to live with the unimaginable
[00:53.730]I spend hours in the garden
[00:57.590]I walk alone to the store
[01:01.130]And it's quiet uptown
[01:05.130]I never liked the quiet before
[01:08.550]I take the children to church on Sunday
[01:12.660]A sign of the cross at the door
[01:15.910]And I pray
[01:20.080]That never used to happen before
[01:23.920]If you see him in the street walking by himself
[01:27.660]Talking to himself, have pity
[01:31.160]You would like it uptown, it's quiet uptown
[01:34.960]He is working through the unimaginable
[01:39.090]His hair has gone grey, he passes every day
[01:42.700]They say he walks the length of the city
[01:45.480]You knock me out, I fall apart
[01:49.260]Can you imagine?
[01:57.430]Look at where we are
[02:01.130]Look at where we started
[02:04.180]I know I don't deserve you
[02:07.860]But hear me out, that would be enough
[02:12.230]If I could spare his life
[02:15.950]If I could trade his life for mine
[02:19.890]He'd be standing here right now
[02:22.470]And you would smile
[02:24.320]And that would be enough
[02:27.630]I don't pretend to know
[02:31.410]The challenges we're facing
[02:35.080]I know there's no replacing what we've lost
[02:40.010]And you need time
[02:42.490]But I'm not afraid
[02:46.130]I know who I married
[02:49.770]Just let me stay here by your side
[02:54.400]And that would be enough
[02:57.900]If you see him in the street, walking by her side
[03:01.500]Talking by her side, have pity
[03:04.990]Do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown
[03:08.770]He is trying to do the unimaginable
[03:12.400]If you see him walking in the park, long after dark
[03:16.480]Taking in the sights of the city
[03:19.120]Look around, look around, look around
[03:23.830]They are trying to do the unimaginable
[03:31.060]There are moments that the words don't reach
[03:34.790]There's a grace too powerful to name
[03:38.440]We push away what we could never understand
[03:42.110]We push away the unimaginable
[03:46.150]They're standing in the garden
[03:50.100]Standing there side by side
[03:53.830]She takes his hand
[03:57.600]It's quiet uptown
[04:03.170]Forgiveness, can you imagine?
[04:10.730]Forgiveness, can you imagine?
[04:18.380]If you see him in the street, walking by her side
[04:22.080]Talking by her side, have pity
[04:24.870]Look around, look around
[04:29.330]They are going through the unimaginable
