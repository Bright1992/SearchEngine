[00:14.53]Young hearts just learning to walk for the first time
[00:21.64]Lovers on lock with a cross of the heart hoping not to die
[00:28.90]Ask anyone, life goes fast, faster when you're older
[00:34.35]So don't close your eyes and come back when it's over
[00:38.27]Young hearts leave it all, leave it all behind
[00:42.08]
[00:46.17]And I already told ya, I'm here to stay
[00:49.94]Hell or high water, I'll find a way
[00:53.76]And I won't give up, if I don't get paid
[00:57.57]And I'll do it my way
[01:00.62]
[01:00.64]Young hearts on fire, rebel runaways
[01:04.57]Burning with desire, chasing time away
[01:08.37]Young hearts on fire, you know they say
[01:12.13]Better to go up in flames, than fade away
[01:15.89]
[01:46.48]Young hearts once broken apart coming back to life
[01:53.08]Tangled in knots what a way to get caught it was worth the ride
[02:00.61]Ask anyone, life goes fast, faster with you're older
[02:05.71]So don't pay no mind, keep marching like a soldier
[02:09.52]Young hearts, put it on, put it on the line
[02:13.51]
[02:17.52]And I already told ya, I'm here to stay
[02:21.39]Hell or high water, I'll find a way
[02:25.17]And I won't give up, if I don't get paid
[02:29.05]And I'll do it my way
[02:31.94]
[02:32.12]Young hearts on fire, rebel runaways
[02:36.00]Burning with desire, chasing time away
[02:39.75]Young hearts on fire, you know they say
[02:43.59]Better to go up in flames, than fade away
