[00:02.94]If I told you this was only gonna hurt
[00:06.43]If I warned you that the fire's gonna burn
[00:10.16]Would you walk in? Would you let me do it first?
[00:13.82]Do it all in the name of love
[00:17.03]Would you let me lead you even when you're blind?

[00:28.07]Would you call in the name of love?
[00:30.51]
[00:30.72]In the name of love, name of love
[00:37.93]In the name of love, name of love

[01:50.62]I wanna testify

[02:01.00]And it's all in the name of love
[02:03.65]
[02:03.94]In the name of love, name of love
[02:11.09]In the name of love, name of love
[02:18.20]
[02:18.32]In the name of
[02:21.64]In the name, name
[02:29.00]In the name, name
