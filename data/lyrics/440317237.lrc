[00:19.60]When you try your best but you don't succeed
[00:26.45]When you get what you want but not what you need
[00:33.82]When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
[00:39.98]Stuck in reverse
[00:46.63]
[00:48.36]And the tears come streaming down your face
[00:55.79]When you lose something you can't replace
[01:03.26]When you love someone but it goes to waste
[01:10.11]Could it be worse?
[01:16.64]
[01:20.89]Lights will guide you home
[01:27.77]And ignite your bones
[01:34.50]And I will try to fix you
[01:41.85]
[01:46.29]And high up above or down below
[01:53.23]When you're too in love to let it go
[01:59.89]But if you never try you'll never know
[02:06.20]Just what you're worth
[02:12.83]
[02:16.23]Lights will guide you home
[02:23.32]And ignite your bones
[02:30.24]And I will try to fix you
[02:36.37]
[02:37.80]Tears stream down your face
[02:43.38]When you lose something you cannot replace
[02:50.92]Tears stream down your face
[02:55.79]And I...
[03:04.37]Tears stream down your face
[03:10.80]I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
[03:17.59]Tears stream down your face
[03:22.37]And I...
[03:27.12]
[03:30.97]Lights will guide you home
[03:38.19]And ignite your bones
[03:45.28]And I, I will try to fix you
