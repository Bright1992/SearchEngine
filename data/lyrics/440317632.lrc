[00:01.96]
[00:15.01]A toast to the groom!
[00:16.50](to the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
[00:19.14]To the bride!
[00:20.53](to the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
[00:23.08]From your sister
[00:24.48](Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
[00:26.97]Who is always by your side
[00:28.86](by your side, by your side)
[00:30.93]To your union and the hope that you provide
[00:36.52](you provide, you provide)
[00:38.53]May you always (always)
[00:42.73]Be satisfied (Rewind)
[00:45.41]
[00:46.60]Rewind!
[00:48.24]
[00:54.49]I remember that night, I just might
[00:56.30]I remember that night, I just might
[00:58.16]I remember that night, I remember that—
[01:00.01]
[01:02.19]I remember that night, I just might
[01:04.01]Regret that night for the rest of my days
[01:05.78]I remember those soldier boys
[01:07.60]Tripping over themselves to win our praise
[01:09.83]I remember that dreamlike candlelight
[01:11.76]Like a dream that you can’t quite place
[01:13.62]But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
[01:17.05]Time I saw your face
[01:18.08]
[01:19.21]I have never been the same
[01:21.11]Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
[01:24.82]And when you said “Hi,”
[01:26.71]I forgot my dang name
[01:28.91]Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame
[01:30.85]This is not a game…
[01:32.83]
[01:33.37]You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
[01:37.38]I’m sure I don’t know what you mean, you forget yourself
[01:40.88]You’re like me, I’ve never been satisfied
[01:45.26]Is that right?
[01:47.31]I have never been satisfied
[01:50.70]My name's Angelica Schuyler
[01:52.93]Alexander Hamilton
[01:55.18]Where’s your fam’ly from?
[01:57.39]Unimportant, there’s a million things I haven’t done
[02:00.75]Just you wait, just you wait...
[02:03.62]
[02:03.85]So so so—
[02:04.51]So this is what it feels like to match wits
[02:06.31]With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
[02:08.32]The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
[02:09.74]It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
[02:12.41]The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
[02:14.32]Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
[02:16.12]A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
[02:17.90]A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a
[02:20.12]Bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give him a chance
[02:21.75]I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
[02:23.61]His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
[02:25.50]He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants
[02:27.74]Handsome, boy, does he know it!
[02:29.86]Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
[02:31.65]I wanna take him far away from this place
[02:33.47]Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is
[02:35.12]
[02:35.70]Helpless
[02:37.27]And I know she is
[02:39.59]Helpless
[02:40.96]And her eyes are just
[02:43.26]Helpless
[02:44.63]And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time
[02:50.58]
[02:57.19]I’m a girl in a world in which
[02:58.76]My only job is to marry rich
[03:00.73]My father has no sons so I’m the one
[03:02.89]Who has to social climb for one
[03:04.65]So I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
[03:06.68]New York City is insidious
[03:08.70]And Alexander is penniless
[03:10.13]Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less
[03:12.20]
[03:13.10](doesn’t mean I want him any less)
[03:14.45](doesn’t mean I want him any less)
[03:16.36](doesn’t mean I want him any less)
[03:18.10]
[03:18.62]He’s after me 'cause I’m a Schuyler sister
[03:20.81]That elevates his status, I’d
[03:22.38]Have to be naïve to set that aside
[03:24.33]Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
[03:29.15]Now that’s his bride
[03:30.64]Nice going, Angelica, he was right
[03:32.48]You will never be satisfied
[03:33.70]
[03:36.48](I will never be satisfied)
[03:39.99](I will never be satisfied)
[03:41.71]
[03:42.19]I know my sister like I know my own mind
[03:45.26]You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
[03:49.07]If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
[03:52.97]He’d be mine
[03:53.99]She would say, “I’m fine”
[03:55.48]But she’d be lying
[03:57.34]
[03:57.96]But when I fantasize at night
[03:59.74]It’s Alexander’s eyes
[04:01.95]As I romanticize what might have been
[04:05.10]If I hadn’t sized him up so quickly
[04:10.01]At least my dear Eliza’s his wife
[04:15.27]At least I keep his eyes in my life…
[04:21.23]
[04:24.33]A toast to the groom!
[04:25.90](to the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
[04:27.78]To the bride!
[04:28.95](to the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
[04:31.73]From your sister
[04:33.20](Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
[04:35.98]Who is always by your side
[04:37.85](by your side, by your side)
[04:39.57]To your union and the hope that you provide
[04:45.24](you provide, you provide)
[04:47.19]May you always
[04:51.17]Be satisfied
[04:54.81]
[04:55.03]And I know (yeah)
[04:58.56]She’ll be happy as his bride
[05:02.42]And I know
[05:06.46]He will never be satisfied
[05:09.11]I will never be satisfied
