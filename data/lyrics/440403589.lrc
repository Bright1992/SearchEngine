[00:17.78]Fire and the ice colliding, I wanna go deep and dive in
[00:25.41]It's heaven on Earth but hell of a night to melt into one
[00:33.64]She's never been afraid of sirens, head down but keep drivin'
[00:42.00]Damn we might crash moving so fast but baby
[00:48.56]
[00:48.82]Oh, don't stop, I need it
[00:52.66]Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
[00:56.73]My heart beating, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
[01:04.57]Oh Lord, forgive us, our love, we've lost control baby
[01:11.39]Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
[01:19.33]Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh
[01:26.88]
[01:29.39]Darkness and light, streaming, the end of our life beginning
[01:37.20]No longer alone, my will become gone, we melt into one
[01:45.35]Both hands on the floor, you go low
[01:49.13]Who was I before? I don't know
[01:53.21]And who am I now? Your body shows how
[01:57.23]The past just has no meaning
[02:00.34]
[02:00.52]Don't stop, I need it
[02:04.21]Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
[02:08.41]My heart beating, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
[02:16.28]Oh Lord, forgive us, our love, we've lost control baby
[02:23.02]Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
[02:30.85]Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh
[02:40.36]
[02:44.83]Oh yeah, yeah
[02:55.46]
[03:07.42]Oh, don't stop, I need it
[03:15.05]Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
[03:19.15]My heart beating, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
[03:27.04]Oh Lord, forgive us, our love, we've lost control baby
[03:33.86]Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
[03:41.72]Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh
