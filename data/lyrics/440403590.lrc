[00:14.39]Yeah we used to flirt with freedom
[00:18.20]'Fore everybody knew our name
[00:22.49]We became their favorite secret
[00:26.43]Love for love and not for fame
[00:30.30]Oh when I was your user

[00:46.68]
[00:47.46]But oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed
[00:53.75]Over exposed
[00:55.77]But oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
[01:01.72]And now we know, life on overload, love, love...
