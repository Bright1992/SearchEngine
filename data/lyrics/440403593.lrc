[00:15.07]Can you just stay through the night
[00:21.76]Turn out the bed in the blinds
[00:26.58]Before your turn around
[00:29.17]Can you just stay through the night
[00:34.71]Let me breathe you in until gravity
[00:38.41]And we fall through the hole in the light
[00:41.86]Make this our kingdom
[00:43.75]Somewhere where good love conquers and not divide cause
[00:49.57]I may not know a lot of things but I feel it in my chest
[00:56.58]Know I won't let the blue flame die
[01:00.83]We can't lose hope just yet
[01:03.30]'Cause it's once just once in a lifetime
[01:06.60]We're scared to love but it's alright
[01:10.53]I may not know a lot of things but I know that we're surefire
[01:21.72]Know that we're surefire
[01:25.08]
[01:31.28]Can't keep this bed warm on the left side
[01:38.11]When something is cold is a goodbye
[01:43.08]Why don't you turn around
[01:45.31]Ignore all that shit from the outside
[01:51.41]The world is a nightmare
[01:53.19]Wake up and stay here
[01:54.87]Let me be on your side
[01:58.30]We'll make this our kingdom
[02:00.25]Somewhere where good love conquers and not divide
[02:05.17]And oh my oh my oh my oh my god
[02:09.00]I'm so I'm so I'm so tired of fighting
[02:12.10]Let go giving let go and give up
[02:16.19]
[02:20.10]I may not know a lot of things but I feel it in my chest
[02:26.83]Know I won't let the blue flame die
[02:31.10]We can't lose hope just yet
[02:33.65]'Cause it's once just once in a lifetime
[02:37.06]We're scared to love but it's alright
[02:40.89]I may not know a lot of things but I know that we're surefire
[02:52.35]Know that we're surefire
[03:00.60]And oh my oh my oh my oh my god
[03:04.37]I'm so I'm so I'm so tired of fighting
[03:07.78]Let go giving let go and give up
[03:11.51]
[03:15.82]I may not know a lot of things but I feel it in my chest
[03:22.60]If we just let the blue flame die the devil wins this bet
[03:29.31]It's once just once in a lifetime
[03:32.92]We're scared to love but it's alright
[03:36.58]I may not know a lot of things but I know that we're surefire
[03:47.75]Know that we're surefire
[03:50.61]
