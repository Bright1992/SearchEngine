[00:13.100]We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
[00:17.900]We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[00:22.840]We don't love anymore
[00:25.160]What was all of it for?
[00:27.110]Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[00:32.370]I just heard you found the one you've been looking
[00:35.710]You've been looking for
[00:38.040]I wish I would have known that wasn't me
[00:41.980]Cause even after all this time I still wonder
[00:45.410]Why I can't move on
[00:47.860]Just the way you did so easily
[00:51.570]Don't wanna know
[00:53.690]If you're looking into her eyes
[00:56.000]If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
[01:01.520]I overdosed
[01:03.390]Should've known your love was a game
[01:05.660]Now I can't get you out of my brain
[01:08.100]Oh, it's such a shame
[01:10.850]We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
[01:15.530]We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[01:20.370]We don't love anymore
[01:22.740]What was all of it for?
[01:25.070]Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[01:29.930]I just hope you're lying next to somebody
[01:33.310]Who knows how to love you like me
[01:35.660]There must be a good reason that you're gone
[01:39.510]Every now and then I think you
[01:41.810]Might want me to come show up at your door
[01:45.560]But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
[01:49.380]Don't wanna know
[01:51.370]If you're looking into her eyes
[01:53.680]If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
[01:59.260]I overdosed
[02:00.810]Should've known your love was a game
[02:03.370]But I can't get you out of my brain
[02:06.080]Oh, it's such a shame
[02:08.390]We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
[02:13.180]We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[02:17.920]We don't love anymore
[02:20.410]What was all of it for?
[02:21.760]Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[02:35.760]是那处曾相见
[02:57.760]是那处曾相见
[03:24.190]We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
[03:28.820]We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
[03:33.540]We don't love anymore
[03:36.010]What was all of it for?
