[00:15.43]Selling a dream
[00:17.42]Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
[00:21.42]On a miracle
[00:22.85]
[00:23.69]Say, go through the darkest of days
[00:25.96]Heaven's a heartbreak away
[00:27.95]Never let you go, never let me down
[00:31.71]Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
[00:33.90]Driving the edge of a knife
