[00:13.03]Maybe I'm not enough
[00:14.70]
[00:16.82]I can't give you what you need anymore
[00:20.86]
[00:25.73]Maybe it's just my luck
[00:27.44]
[00:29.66]That I got less than what I bargained for
[00:33.64]
[00:38.39]So if what you feel is no longer real
[00:45.58]I can just walk away
[00:49.83]
[00:51.33]But don't leave me hangin'
[00:54.35]
[00:55.21]If you're unsure no more back and forth
[01:02.17]
[01:03.28]Can you help me
[01:05.18]
[01:08.80]Tell me what I'm fighting for
[01:11.24]
[01:16.18]Please just tell me
[01:17.98]
[01:20.03]You can be honest if I'm fighting on my own
[01:24.06]
[01:26.10]I can't live if I'm on this battlefield alone
[01:30.47]
[01:42.48]Maybe I'm not as tough as I used to be
[01:50.44]
[01:55.22]It's getting to be too much
[01:58.00]
[01:59.34]I would rather you just set me free
[02:03.58]
[02:08.06]So if what you feel is no longer real
[02:14.61]
[02:15.17]I can just walk away
[02:19.53]
[02:20.85]But don't leave me hangin'
[02:23.92]
[02:24.86]If you're unsure no more back and forth
[02:32.16]
[02:32.87]Can you help me
[02:34.81]
[02:38.49]Tell me what I'm fighting for
[02:40.79]
[02:45.64]Please just tell me
[02:47.60]
[02:49.78]You can be honest if I'm fighting on my own
[02:54.12]
[02:55.68]I can't live if I'm on this battlefield alone
[02:59.89]
[03:11.83]Like a battlefield
[03:14.14]
[03:22.97]I'm on this battlefield alone
[03:26.19]
[03:36.36]Battlefield alone
