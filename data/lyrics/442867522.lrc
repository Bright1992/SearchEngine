[00:11.25]I had a vision
[00:14.79]A vision of my nails in the kitchen
[00:20.13]Scratching counter tops, I was screaming
[00:25.32]My back arched like a cat, my position couldn't stop you were hitting it
[00:32.63]And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy
[00:42.51]And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, I love it, Starboy
[00:53.34]And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy
[01:03.94]And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy
[01:12.51]
[01:15.80]I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl
[01:24.67]I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl
[01:36.95]I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl
[01:46.72]I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl
[01:50.16]
