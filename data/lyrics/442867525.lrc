[00:09.52]I realized, I belong to you
[00:18.12]I feel the darkness, I run away from you
[00:23.53]
[00:23.93]Hey, don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
[00:29.98]Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
[00:34.34]I learned to love you, the way you need
[00:38.88]'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same
[00:43.31]
[00:43.53]I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
[00:49.86]Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
[00:52.05]I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
[00:57.09]Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
[01:00.11]
[01:00.57]I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
[01:05.65]The one I could’ve fled, to be with by myself
[01:09.79]'Cause I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
[01:14.65]Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
[01:17.63]
[01:19.25]Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh
[01:28.08]If I die tonight, would you regret it?
[01:34.87]
[01:35.42]Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
[01:39.88]'Cause I can't function, no I won't last
[01:44.11]I swear I'll love you just like the past
[01:48.66]'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same
[01:53.18]
[01:53.37]I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
[01:58.61]Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
[02:01.89]Oh, I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
[02:06.74]Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
[02:10.05]
[02:10.56]I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
[02:15.21]The one I could’ve fled, to be with by myself
[02:19.45]'Cause I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
[02:24.20]Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
[02:27.55]
[02:28.14]When I feel the love, girl I hesitate
[02:32.53]It's what I'm guilty of, oh yeah
[02:36.92]I can't get enough, I'm insane
[02:41.31]Without your touch, touch, touch
[02:45.74]I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing'
[02:50.33]Nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing'
[02:54.70]Nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
