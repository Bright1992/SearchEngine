[00:00.25]Why are you keeping me at a distance?
[00:04.20]All that I'm asking for is forgiveness
[00:08.18]Are you even listening?
[00:10.22]Am I talking to myself again?
[00:16.05]I keep on staring up at the ceiling
[00:19.42]Waiting for you to give me some kind of reason
[00:23.92]Are you even listening?
[00:25.96]Am I talking to myself again?
[00:29.80]
[00:31.60]And I know you don't owe me your love
[00:35.44]And I know that you don't owe me nothing at all
[00:39.70]Ain't no way I'm giving up on you
[00:44.84]
[00:46.64]Don't leave me here in the dark when it's hard to see
[00:51.22]Show me your heart, shed a light on me
[00:54.94]If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
[01:02.38]You know I can't live without you, I'm on my knees
[01:06.90]Where are you now? Shed a light on me
[01:10.58]If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
[01:14.62]
[01:34.70]Why when I call, you never answer?
[01:38.50]I try to talk, you keep on dancing
[01:42.68]I can feel you on my skin
[01:44.48]But am I only dancing with the wind?
[01:47.83]
[01:50.24]And I know you don't owe me your love
[01:54.17]And I know that you don't owe me nothing at all
[01:58.35]Ain't no way I'm giving up on you
[02:03.86]
[02:05.18]Don't leave me here in the dark when it's hard to see
[02:09.86]Show me your heart, shed a light on me
[02:13.57]If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
[02:17.59]If you love me, say something
[02:21.05]You know I can't live without you, I'm on my knees
[02:25.56]Where are you now? Shed a light on me
[02:29.40]If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
[02:33.53]
[02:36.95]Shed a light, shed a light on me
[02:44.90]Shed a light, shed a light on me
[02:52.56]Don't leave me here in the dark when it's hard to see
[02:57.11]Show me your heart, shed a light on me
[03:00.78]If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
