[00:07.71]It has begun again, my friend
[00:15.72]In this room, we are nothing but strangers in a bed
[00:23.99]You made me fall again, my friend
[00:32.17]How can I forget when you said love was just pretend?
[00:40.35]When I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
[00:48.54]But she told me that to love her is so crazy
[00:55.95]'Cause she loves to lay
[00:59.00]I learned the hard way
[01:04.31]She loves to lay, I'm up to play
[01:08.51]I learned the hard way
[01:12.53]She loves to lay
[01:15.27]Know I learned the hard way
[01:19.71]She loves to lay, it's all a game
[01:24.88]I learned the hard way
[01:29.88]It has begun again, my friend
[01:37.99]In your heart, we are nothing but strangers in the end
[01:46.01]Then I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
[01:54.20]But she told me that to love her is so crazy
[02:01.55]'Cause she loves to lay
[02:04.63]I learned the hard way
[02:10.00]She loves to lay, I'm up to play
[02:14.48]I learned the hard way
[02:18.19]She loves to lay
[02:22.11]Know I learned the hard way
[02:26.29]She loves to lay, it's all a game
[02:30.40]I learned the hard way
[02:36.02]I think there's someone else
[02:39.55]Worth your time, from the start
[02:43.88]He's just one call away
[02:47.63]From your mind, and your heart
[02:53.87]It has begun, begun
[02:56.40]Again, again, my friend, hey!
[03:01.37]'Cause she loves to lay
[03:05.30]I learned the hard way
[03:09.53]She loves to lay, I'm up to play
[03:13.46]I learned the hard way
[03:17.57]She loves to lay
[03:21.73]Know I learned the hard way
[03:25.75]She loves to lay, it's all a game
[03:30.09]I learned the hard way
