[00:12.91]Heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue
[00:16.06]I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump
[00:19.21]Fingers letting go of the wheel when I cum
[00:22.35]Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum
[00:25.60]David Carradine, I'ma die when I cum
[00:28.84]She just givin' head, she don't know what I've done
[00:31.93]Like I'm James Dean, I'ma die when I'm young
[00:35.12]Die when I'm young, die when I'm young
[00:39.43]Heaven knows that I've been told
[00:42.24]Paid for the life that I chose
[00:45.72]If I could, I'd trade it all
[00:48.78]Trade it for a halo
[00:51.37]And she said that she'll pray for me
[00:55.07]I said, "It's too late for me
[00:58.30]'Cause I think it's safe to say..."
[01:01.55]This ain't ordinary life
[01:04.78]This ain't ordinary life
[01:07.72]This ain't ordinary life
[01:10.96]This ain't ordinary life
[01:15.00]No ordinary life
[01:17.49]This ain't ordinary life
[01:20.41]This ain't ordinary life
[01:23.75]This ain't ordinary life
[01:29.45]Vahalla is where all the righteous are led
[01:32.43]Moorhall is where all the damned will be kept
[01:35.62]Devil on my lap and a cross on my neck
[01:38.81]Cross on my neck, cross on my neck
[01:41.95]Over 45, I'ma drift on a bend
[01:45.14]Do a buck 20, I'ma fly off the edge
[01:48.39]Everybody said it would hurt in the end
[01:51.52]Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin'
[01:55.86]She said that she'll pray for me
[01:58.60]I said, "It's too late for me
[02:01.80]'Cause I think it's safe to say..."
[02:05.74]This ain't ordinary life
[02:08.28]This ain't ordinary life
[02:11.43]This ain't ordinary life
[02:14.66]This ain't ordinary life
[02:18.66]No ordinary life
[02:21.00]This ain't ordinary life
[02:24.20]This ain't ordinary life
[02:27.34]This ain't ordinary life
[02:36.75]Angels all singin' in holy monestaries, yeah
[02:42.53]My soul is buried in low Ferraris
[02:46.42]I'm sorry, I'm sorry
[02:49.06]Halos are given to ordinary lives
[02:55.75]No, but this ain't ordinary life
[03:00.80]This ain't ordinary life
[03:03.63]This ain't ordinary life
[03:06.84]This ain't ordinary life
[03:10.67]No ordinary life
[03:13.22]This ain't ordinary life
[03:16.46]This ain't ordinary life
[03:19.55]This ain't ordinary life
[03:23.44]No ordinary life
[03:27.58]Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
