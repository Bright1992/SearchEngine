[00:02.370]中文词：曲婉婷
[00:04.370]On the edge for you …
[00:12.420]带我去 一个地方
[00:18.060]穿过蓝色的忧伤
[00:23.990]看不清未来在哪里
[00:30.360]唯一安慰我的是你
[00:33.050]从此不再孤寂
[00:47.080]On the edge for you…
[00:48.330]Now we stand, stand, stand…
[00:53.270]On the edge for you…
[01:24.040]Every step that I take
[01:25.460]I go all out, I don’t stall out
[01:26.680]Get close enough to I brake
[01:28.040]I’m off like everything’s at stake
[01:29.820]Money down on my fate
[01:31.180]Keep my passion over these fakes
[01:32.660]Down that love avenue, your latitudes
[01:34.050]All I need is that taste
[01:35.830]On the edge
[01:36.790]Off the feds
[01:37.390]Follow me way off the grid
[01:38.860]GPS way off the ledge
[01:40.370]We the movement for all the heads
[01:41.910]Breaking every law for this
[01:43.350]Aim for greatness and I wont miss
[01:45.570]Gotta raise that fist
[01:46.540]On the edge till my people lift
[01:48.440]带我去 一个地方
[01:53.900]穿过蓝色的忧伤
[01:59.940]看不清未来在哪里
[02:06.310]唯一安慰我的是你
[02:08.870]从此不再孤寂
[02:17.180]On the edge for you…
[02:24.360]Now we stand, stand, stand…
[02:29.270]On the edge for you
