[00:14.00]Now we're staring at the ceiling
[00:17.31]You're so pretty when you're mad
[00:20.81]All that I can hear is breathing oh oh
[00:27.72]And we're stuck inside the silence
[00:31.10]In a cold cold world
[00:34.65]We're too proud to say we're sorry oh oh
[00:41.46]Right now it feels like we're bleeding
[00:44.81]So deep that we might not get back up
[00:48.27]Our words will tear through the surface
[00:51.30]Like a paper like a papercut
[00:55.24]Right now I don't know why I love you
[00:58.46]But by the morning when we wake up
[01:01.96]I'll reach for you and remember
[01:04.95]It was just a paper just a papercut
[01:07.99]
[01:14.13]Oh oh oh
[01:30.10]
[01:36.20]I find refuge in the distance
[01:39.53]Even when we're breaking down
[01:43.06]Can we pause it just for one kiss
[01:46.24]Oh oh
[01:50.04]'Cause I never meant to hurt you
[01:53.39]And I know you feel the same
[01:56.87]Still the only one I run to oh oh
[02:03.85]Right now it feels like we're bleeding
[02:07.11]So deep that we might not get back up
[02:10.51]Our words will tear through the surface
[02:13.55]Like a paper like a papercut
[02:17.21]Right now I don't know why I love you
[02:20.83]But by the morning when we wake up
[02:24.15]I'll reach for you and remember
[02:27.15]It was just a paper just a papercut
[02:30.97]
[02:36.63]Oh
[02:43.61]Oh
[02:50.54]Oh
[02:58.35]Oh oh oh oh oh~
[03:34.03]
