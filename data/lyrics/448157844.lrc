[01:00.22]I want to go back,
[01:03.11]Forget that it's over
[01:06.28]Painted in black,
[01:08.73]When you left me alone
[01:11.48]I never knew, she was sleeping next door
[01:15.61]With the kid I grew up with,
[01:18.20]And I can't go back to her anymore, no more
[01:26.32]You tell me you were happier with him, you want me to stay
[01:31.66]And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away
[01:37.41]But then you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
[01:43.29]No, I can't lift the weight
[01:48.79]I can't lift the weight
[01:52.38]
[01:56.71]Put you in the past,
[01:59.25]Try to forget you 'cause it's over
[02:02.69]And every time you ask
[02:04.94]I pretend I'm okay
[02:08.28]You're inside my head
[02:10.68]In the middle of the night
[02:12.45]When I don't feel right
[02:13.45]I dream I can hold you,
[02:14.58]And I can't go back to you anymore,no
[02:23.07]You tell me you were happier with him, you want me to stay
[02:28.24]And you tell me that you needed time, but you push me away
[02:34.49]But then you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
[02:40.25]But, I can't lift the weight
[02:43.69]
[02:46.37]I can't lift the weight
[02:51.15]
[02:54.00]And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight
[02:56.00]Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
[02:59.52]And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight
[03:02.24]Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
[03:05.51]And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight
[03:08.48]Yeah, you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
[03:11.28]And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight
[03:17.42]You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
[03:23.51]And you tell me that you needed time but you, but you push me away
[03:30.11]But then you try to take me back
[03:33.32]Say someday you will change, but I don't wanna wait
[03:38.80]
