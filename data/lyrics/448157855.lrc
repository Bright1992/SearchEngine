[01:10.29]I thought that I've been hurt before
[01:17.54]But no one's ever left me quite this sore
[01:25.60]Your words cut deeper than a knife
[01:30.74]Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
[01:35.52]
[01:38.40]Got a feeling that I'm going under
[01:41.76]But I know that I'll make it out alive
[01:45.30]If I quit calling you my lover
[01:49.30]
[01:50.29]You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
[01:54.78]Falling onto my knees
[01:57.10]And now that I'm without your kisses
[02:01.10]I'll be needing stitches
[02:04.25]Tripping over myself, aching
[02:07.56]Begging you to come help
[02:09.82]And now that I'm without your kisses
[02:14.20]Baby, I'll be needing stitches
[02:18.60]
[02:55.84]Got a feeling that I'm going under
[02:59.13]But I know that I'll make it out alive
[03:02.31]If I quit calling you my lover
[03:05.56]Move on
[03:06.80]
[03:07.11]You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
[03:11.49]Falling onto my knees
[03:13.71]And now that I'm without your kisses
[03:17.91]I'll be needing stitches
[03:21.60]Tripping over myself, aching
[03:24.28]Begging you to come help
[03:26.52]And now that I'm without your kisses
[03:30.70]I'll be needing stitches
[03:33.46]
[03:34.28]Just like a moth drawn to a flame
[03:39.69]Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
[03:47.40]Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
[03:52.20]Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
[03:55.32]I'm left seeing red on my own
[03:57.85]
[03:59.86]Got a feeling that I'm going under
[04:03.60]But I know that I'll make it out alive
[04:06.28]If I quit calling you my lover
[04:09.47]Move on
[04:10.62]
[04:11.30]You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
[04:15.48]Falling onto my knees
[04:17.71]And now that I'm without your kisses
[04:21.90]I'll be needing stitches
[04:25.70]Tripping over myself, aching
[04:28.26]Begging you to come help
[04:30.53]And now that I'm without your kisses
[04:34.70]I'll be needing stitches
[04:37.39]
[04:50.86]Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
[04:53.88]Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
[04:57.11]Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
[05:00.29]Needle and the thread, SCREAM!
[05:03.44]Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
[05:06.72]Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
[05:09.92]Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
[05:13.14]Get you out of my head
[05:14.58]
[05:15.70]You watch me
[05:23.37]And now that I'm without your kisses
[05:27.48]I'll be needing stitches
[05:30.67]Tripping over myself, aching
[05:33.86]Begging you to come help
[05:36.80]And now that I'm without your kisses
[05:40.29]I'll be needing stitches
