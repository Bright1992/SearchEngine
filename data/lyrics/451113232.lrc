[00:43.67]We're born to fly
[00:46.23]So let's keep living 'til it all falls down
[00:51.49]Let's close our eyes
[00:54.80]And let the moment drive the whole world out
[00:58.25]We're in this together
[01:02.30]Hear our hearts beat together
[01:06.12]We stand strong together
[01:09.90]We're in this forever
[01:20.44]This one's for you
[02:08.73]Waving colored flags
[02:11.37]We won't surrender, there's no standing down
[02:16.57]There's a playing field
[02:19.21]It's full of winners, we're breaking new ground
[02:23.86]We're in this together
[02:27.11]Hear our hearts beat together
[02:31.90]We stand strong together
[02:35.50]We're in this forever
[02:45.72]This one's for you
