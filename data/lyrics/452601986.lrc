[00:11.82]The club isn't the best place to find a lover
[00:14.21]So the bar is where I go
[00:16.71]Me and my friends at the table doing shots
[00:19.37]Drinking faster and then we talk slow
[00:21.22]You come over and start up a conversation with just me
[00:23.82]And trust me I'll give it a chance now
[00:26.27]Take my hand, stop, Put Van The Man on the jukebox
[00:28.51]And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
[00:31.21]Girl, you know I want your love
[00:33.35]Your love was handmade for somebody like me
[00:36.35]Come on now, follow my lead
[00:38.20]I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
[00:40.54]Boy, let's not talk too much
[00:42.89]Grab on my waist and put that body on me
[00:45.83]Come on now, follow my lead
[00:47.87]Come—come on now, follow my lead

[01:08.55]I'm in love with the shape of you
[01:09.38]
[01:09.83]One week in we let the story begin
[01:11.72]We're going out on our first date
[01:14.22]But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
[01:16.01]Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
[01:18.92]We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
[01:20.67]And how your family is doin' okay
[01:22.81]And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
[01:26.00]Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
[01:28.78]Girl, you know I want your love
[01:31.02]Your love was handmade for somebody like me

[01:53.53]Although my heart is falling too
[01:55.88]I'm in love with your body
[01:58.17]And last night you were in my room
[02:00.67]And now my bedsheets smell like you
