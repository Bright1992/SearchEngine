[00:09.97]The club isn't the best place to find a lover
[00:11.88]So the bar is where I go
[00:14.82]Me and my friends at the table doing shots
[00:17.07]Drinking faster and then we talk slow
[00:19.52]You come over and start up a conversation with just me
[00:21.86]And trust me I'll give it a chance now
[00:24.30]Take my hand, stop, Put Van The Man on the jukebox
[00:26.88]And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
[00:29.23]Girl, you know I want your love
[00:31.52]Your love was handmade for somebody like me
[00:34.48]Come on now, follow my lead
[00:36.53]I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
[00:38.87]Boy, let's not talk too much
[00:41.21]Grab on my waist and put that body on me
[00:44.62]Come on now, follow my lead
[00:46.42]Come—come on now, follow my lead

[01:21.54]I'm in love with your body
[01:23.43]Every day discovering something brand new
[01:26.58]I'm in love with the shape of you
[01:28.23]One week in we let the story begin
[01:30.13]We're going out on our first date
[01:32.91]But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
[01:35.05]Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
[01:37.55]We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
[01:40.04]And how your family is doin' okay
[01:42.49]And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
[01:44.93]Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
[01:47.73]Girl, you know I want your love
[01:50.03]Your love was handmade for somebody like me
[01:52.82]Come on now, follow my lead

[02:30.27]We push and pull like a magnet do
[02:32.56]Although my heart is falling too
[02:34.96]I'm in love with your body
[02:36.96]And last night you were in my room
[02:40.04]And now my bedsheets smell like you
[02:41.99]Every day discovering something brand new
[02:44.69]I'm in love with your body
