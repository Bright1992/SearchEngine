[00:00.25]You always call me full of regret
[00:06.02]You want me to save you again
[00:11.21]
[00:23.41]After all these years, the days go by
[00:26.33]I've seen you fall a million times
[00:29.23]Everybody makes mistakes
[00:33.52]
[00:34.80]It feels so hard to watch you hurt
[00:37.63]From that pain a lesson learned
[00:40.58]This is how you find your way
[00:44.89]
[00:57.83]You feel so lost I've been there too
[01:00.58]Skies so dark no way through
[01:03.47]Stories only scars can tell
[01:07.77]
[01:08.91]I've got so much love for you my friend
[01:11.94]Ride or die until the end
[01:14.92]But only you can save yourself
[01:18.72]
[01:19.16]You just have to
[01:20.42]
[01:20.80]Listen, listen
[01:23.48]I hope that you know
[01:26.36]Listen, listen
[01:29.07]I won't let you go
[01:32.08]I wish I could save you from the pain you've been through
[01:37.49]And all I can tell you is the best thing to do
[01:42.84](You gotta)
[01:43.63]Listen, listen
[02:00.33]To your heart
[02:02.27]
[02:06.43]Listen, listen
[02:12.04]Listen, listen
[02:15.50]
[02:17.78]Listen, listen 一つだけ
[02:23.45]Listen, listen 信じよう
[02:29.30]降り止まない雨などない
[02:34.80]And all I can tell you is the best thing to do
[02:40.14](You gotta)
[02:40.71]Listen, listen
[02:46.33]Listen, listen
[02:52.04]Listen, listen
[02:57.49]To your heart
[03:00.71]
[03:03.56]Listen, listen
[03:08.85]To your heart
[03:10.89]
