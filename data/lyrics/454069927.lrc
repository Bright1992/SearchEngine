[00:02.06]The club isn't the best place to find a lover
[00:04.61]So the bar is where I go
[00:07.25]Me and my friends at the table doing shots
[00:09.40]Drinking faster and then we talk slow
[00:12.15]You come over and start up a conversation with just me
[00:14.41]And trust me I'll give it a chance now
[00:16.60]Take my hand, stop, Put Van The Man on the jukebox
[00:19.61]And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
[00:22.21]Girl, you know I want your love
[00:24.49]Your love was handmade for somebody like me
[00:27.65]Come on now, follow my lead
[00:29.60]I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
[00:31.94]Boy, let's not talk too much
[00:34.55]Grab on my waist and put that body on me
[00:37.74]Come on now, follow my lead
[00:39.24]Come—come on now, follow my lead
[00:43.24]I'm in love with the shape of you
[00:45.50]We push and pull like a magnet do
[00:48.14]Although my heart is falling too
[00:50.54]I'm in love with your body
[00:52.83]And last night you were in my room
[00:55.39]And now my bedsheets smell like you
[00:57.23]Every day discovering something brand new
[00:59.88]I'm in love with your body
[01:02.13]

[01:27.39]One week in we let the story begin
[01:29.39]We're going out on our first date
[01:32.05]But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
[01:34.54]Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
[01:37.09]We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
[01:38.99]And how your family is doin' okay
[01:41.98]And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
[01:44.43]Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
[01:47.30]Girl, you know I want your love
[01:49.55]Your love was handmade for somebody like me
[01:52.40]Come on now, follow my lead
[01:54.74]I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
[01:57.10]Boy, let's not talk too much
[01:59.55]Grab on my waist and put that body on me
[02:02.50]Come on now, follow my lead
[02:04.45]Come—come on now, follow my lead
[02:08.18]I'm in love with the shape of you
[02:10.47]We push and pull like a magnet do
[02:13.08]Although my heart is falling too
[02:15.42]I'm in love with your body
[02:17.92]And last night you were in my room
[02:20.32]And now my bedsheets smell like you
[02:22.22]Every day discovering something brand new
[02:25.47]I'm in love with your body
[02:29.07]
[02:40.78]
