[00:43.11]Remember, we were staring up to those peaks on the horizon?
[00:50.71]I promised I would never stop
[00:53.79]That in your name, I would climb them
[00:57.04]There's nothing I have wanted more
[01:00.58]The only one I've been waiting for
[01:04.22]So hold your breath and close your eyes
[01:07.81]The end is unknown but, still, we rise
[01:13.25]Counting down, to the light
[01:16.35]Through the night, just waiting for tomorrow
[01:19.99]Almost there, almost time
[01:23.48]
[01:23.83]All my life, just waiting
[01:26.32]
[01:26.56]It's only one more day
[01:29.76]
[01:30.01]It's only one more day
[01:33.05]
[01:33.40]It's only one more day
[01:37.24]
[01:37.49]It's only one more, waiting for tomorrow
[01:48.02]
[02:08.90]Just waiting for tomorrow
[02:18.33]
[02:21.16]
[02:25.26]
[02:26.40]Sleepless nights have paved my way
[02:29.04]And this road is finally ending
[02:33.57]I've killed for just a chance to be in this place where, now, I'm standing
[02:39.91]But fear is creeping up behind all this courage I'm projecting
[02:48.05]I can't find order in my mind
[02:51.24]With this noise inside, so deafening
[02:54.39]
[02:54.68]It's only one more day
[02:59.99]
[03:02.00]It's only one more day
[03:07.67]
[03:15.06]
[03:34.97]
[03:36.96]Just waiting for tomorrow
[03:49.79]
