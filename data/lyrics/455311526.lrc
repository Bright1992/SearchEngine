[00:02.57]
[00:13.69]Tale as old as time
[00:19.40]True as it can be
[00:25.34]Barely even friends
[00:28.45]Then somebody bends
[00:31.50]Unexpectedly
[00:37.22]Just a little change
[00:42.73]Small to say the least
[00:46.47]Both a little scared
[00:48.88]Neither one prepared
[00:51.73]Beauty and the beast
[00:57.95]Ever just the same
[01:03.65]Ever a surprise
[01:09.52]Ever as before and ever just as sure as the sun will rise
[01:20.03]
[01:45.37]Ever just the same
[01:50.85]Ever a surprise
[01:56.25]Ever as before
[01:59.66]And ever just as sure
[02:02.93]As the sun will rise
[02:12.74]Tale as old as time
[02:17.49]Tune as old as song
[02:23.74]Bitter sweet and strange
[02:27.12]Finding you can change
[02:29.90]Learning you were wrong
[02:33.20]
[02:35.32]Certain as the sun
[02:39.38]Certain as the sun
[02:41.65]Rising in the east
[02:45.26]Tale as old as time
[02:47.82]Song as old as rhyme
[02:51.02]Beauty and the beast
[02:57.02]Tale as old as time
[02:59.70]Song as old as rhyme
[03:02.90]Beauty and the beast
