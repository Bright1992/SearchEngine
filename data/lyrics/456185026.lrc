[00:11.63]People say the meanest things
[00:16.95]I've been called a dick, I've been called so many things
[00:21.66]I know I've done some shit that I admit deserves it
[00:25.92]But that...that don't mean it doesn't sting
[00:32.85]Saw you standing outside a bar
[00:37.68]Would have said you're beautiful but I've used that line before
[00:42.95]Now I've had my share of shallow nights
[00:45.88]'Cause I was scared to get it right
[00:48.51]So I was hanging with whoever
[00:51.70]
[00:51.84]But baby then you...
[00:53.56]You love, love, love me, love me better
[00:58.97]You love, love, love me, love me better
[01:03.34]There's been times I gave myself
[01:05.85]To someone else, to someone lesser than you
[01:09.67]Love, love, love me, love me better
[01:13.15]
[01:24.10]Love me better
[01:25.69]
[01:36.98]When I met you I was treading water
[01:42.23]And baby I know you know I got an eye that wanders
[01:46.34]But right now in this car that we're driving to your sister's
[01:51.28]All I'm lookin' for is something that's forever
[01:55.99]Baby then you...
[01:57.61]You love, love, love me, love me better
[02:02.89]You love, love, love me, love me better
[02:07.34]There've been people that I've loved before
[02:10.34]But they were something lesser, 'cause you...
[02:13.58]Love, love, love me, love me better
[02:18.15]
[02:23.29]Love me
[02:27.96]Love me better
[02:34.10]Love me
[02:38.65]Love me better
[02:39.97]
[02:40.92]People say the meanest things
[02:46.15]Yeah, but truth be told, I don't care what they think
[02:50.26]I got someone who is lying in my bed lying right next to me
[02:55.31]Yeah she....loves, loves, loves me
[02:58.87]Loves, loves, loves me, loves me better
[03:03.99]
[03:13.32]Loves me better
[03:24.65]There's been times I gave myself
[03:27.19]To someone else, to someone lesser than you
