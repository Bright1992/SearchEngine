[00:10.30]Lost in your mind
[00:17.11]I wanna know
[00:19.78]Am I losing my mind?
[00:26.15]Never let me go
[00:28.95]
[00:29.39]If this night is not forever
[00:32.21]At least we are together
[00:34.74]I know I'm not alone
[00:37.33]I know I'm not alone
[00:39.60]
[00:39.90]Anywhere, whenever
[00:42.27]Apart, but still together
[00:44.60]I know I'm not alone
[00:47.01]I know I'm not alone
[00:50.13]
[00:57.25]I know I'm not alone
[01:07.29]I know I'm not alone
[01:11.66]
[01:15.52]Unconscious mind
[01:21.26]I'm wide awake
[01:23.91]Wanna feel one last time
[01:31.00]Take my pain away
[01:33.18]
[01:43.23]If this night is not forever
[01:46.61]At least we are together
[01:49.05]I know I'm not alone
[01:51.53]I know I'm not alone
[01:53.66]
[01:54.19]Anywhere, whenever
[01:56.14]Apart, but still together
[01:58.92]I know I'm not alone
[02:01.15]I know I'm not alone
[02:05.71]
[02:11.71]I know I'm not alone
[02:21.48]I know I'm not alone
[02:25.61]
[02:26.40]I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone
[02:32.32]I know I'm not alone
[02:36.15]I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone
[02:42.85]I know I'm not alone
[02:57.17]
