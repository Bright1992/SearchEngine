[00:02.56]
[00:14.72]I always believed that love will surrender
[00:21.24]And I wouldn't go down without a fight
[00:26.67]I always left room for other contenders
[00:31.76]'Cause I might change my mind
[00:35.19]
[00:36.43]Damn, I used to be so cold
[00:38.82]We never ever get too close
[00:41.51]Didn't ever wanna lose control
[00:47.18]But from the moment that I tasted
[00:49.73]I knew that I would have to chase it
[00:52.52]You say hold up, I won't you to be
[00:56.45]
[00:56.75]A one woman man
[01:02.08]A one woman man, oh
[01:07.86]Want you all to my side
[01:11.20]Don't want nobody else
[01:14.14]Oh, you love it
[01:15.88]Oh, you love it
[01:17.17]Won't you be
[01:18.91]A one woman man (one woman)
[01:24.65]A one woman man, oh (one woman)
[01:29.92]
[01:32.82]You made me believe that love was forever
[01:38.14]And love could sustain us through every fight
[01:43.08]I'll let go of all of the other
[01:47.41]Pretenders they'll be wasting my time
[01:52.15]
[01:53.39]I never thought that I would say this
[01:55.93]But I can see ?
[01:59.50]I can see it from the stars
[02:01.79]That I might give you my heart
[02:05.02]From the moment that I met you
[02:07.52]Knew that I would never let you
[02:10.11]Slip away, it's okay
[02:12.40]You can make me
[02:14.25]
[02:14.50]A one woman man
[02:20.18]A one woman man, oh
[02:26.16]Want you all to my side
[02:29.25]Don't want nobody else
[02:31.84]Oh, you love it
[02:33.44]Oh, you love it
[02:34.83]Won't you be
[02:36.72]A one woman man (one woman)
[02:42.35]A one woman man, uh (one woman)
[02:47.04]
[02:49.28]I can never say I loved you
[02:51.81]I kept all my ?
[02:54.41]But you broke in my house
[02:56.80]You've stolen my heart
[02:59.69]Now I'm giving you the key
[03:02.67]That all of you for all of me
[03:05.46]But baby, I promise you'll be
[03:09.49]
[03:10.24]A one woman man, oh
[03:21.20]Want you all to myself
[03:24.03]Don't want nobody else
[03:26.67]Oh, I love it
[03:28.51]Oh, they love it
[03:29.85]I can be
[03:31.85]A one woman man (one woman)
[03:37.27]A one woman man, uh (one woman)
