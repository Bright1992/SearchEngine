[00:09.18]The club isn't the best place to find a lover
[00:11.40]So the bar is where I go
[00:14.15]Me and my friends at the table doing shots
[00:16.17]Drinking fast and then we talk slow
[00:18.70]Come over and start up a conversation with just me
[00:21.18]And trust me I'll give it a chance now
[00:23.37]Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
[00:25.92]And then we start to dance
[00:27.62]
[00:28.08]Say, boy, let's not talk too much
[00:30.94]Grab on my waist and put that body on me
[00:33.92]Come on now, follow my lead
[00:35.47]Come, come on now, follow my lead
[00:37.31]
[00:58.27]I'm in love with the shape of you
[01:00.56]We push and pull like a magnet do
[01:02.89]Although my heart is falling too
[01:05.39]I'm in love with your body
[01:07.73]And last night you were in my room
[01:10.06]And now my bedsheets smell like you
[01:11.99]Every day discovering something brand new
[01:15.00]I'm in love with your body
[01:19.83]I'm in love with your body
[01:21.65]Every day discovering something brand new
[01:24.62]I'm in love with the shape of you
[01:26.35]
[01:45.35]One week in we let the story begin
[01:47.27]We're going out on our first date
[01:49.75]You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
[01:52.09]Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
[01:54.50]We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
[01:56.87]And how your family is doing okay
[01:59.40]Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
[02:01.91]Tell the driver make the radio play
[02:03.70]
[02:04.22]Say, boy, let's not talk too much
[02:06.94]Grab on my waist and put that body on me
[02:09.92]Come on now, follow my lead
[02:11.40]Come, come on now, follow my lead
[02:13.09]
[02:34.26]I'm in love with the shape of you
[02:36.54]We push and pull like a magnet do
[02:38.91]Although my heart is falling too
[02:41.38]I'm in love with your body
[02:43.66]And last night you were in my room
[02:46.15]And now my bedsheets smell like you
[02:48.03]Every day discovering something brand new
[02:50.96]I'm in love, I'm in love love
[02:52.66]
