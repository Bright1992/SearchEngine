[00:11.18]The club isn't the best place to find a lover
[00:13.24]So the bar is where I go
[00:14.95]
[00:15.99]Me and my friends at the table doing shots
[00:18.02]Drinking fast and then we talk slow
[00:19.70]
[00:20.42]You come over and start up a conversation with just me
[00:22.92]And trust me I'll give it a chance now
[00:25.30]Take my hand stop put van the man on the jukebox
[00:27.48]And then we start to dance and now I'm singing like
[00:30.30]Girl you know I want your love
[00:32.18]
[00:32.69]Your love was handmade for somebody like me
[00:35.27]
[00:35.78]Come on now follow my lead
[00:37.68]I may be crazy don't mind me
[00:39.75]Say boy let's not talk too much
[00:42.34]Grab on my waist and put that body on me
[00:45.50]Come on now follow my lead
[00:47.03]Come come on now follow my lead
[00:48.56]
[00:50.77]I'm in love with the shape of you
[00:52.47]
[00:53.01]We push and pull like a magnet do
[00:55.34]Although my heart is falling too
[00:57.05]
[00:57.77]I'm in love with your body
[00:59.23]
[01:00.05]Last night you were in my room
[01:01.66]
[01:02.53]And now my bed sheets smell like you
[01:04.42]Every day discovering something brand new
