[00:00.00] 作曲 : Adele
[00:01.00] 作词 : Adele
[00:16.31]I only wanted to have fun
[00:21.38]Learning to fly, learning to run
[00:25.66]I let my heart decide the way
[00:29.94]When I was young
[00:34.44]Deep down I must have always known
[00:39.32]That this would be inevitable
[00:43.74]To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
[00:48.17]And bear my soul
[00:52.59]I know I'm not the only one
[00:57.46]Who regrets the things they've done
[01:01.99]Sometimes I just feel it's only me
[01:06.05]Who can't stand the reflection that they see
[01:10.67]I miss the air, I miss my friends
[01:15.59]I miss my mother, I miss it when
[01:19.97]Life was a party to be thrown
[01:24.24]But that was a million years ago
[01:29.35]
[02:05.02]I only wanted to have fun
[02:10.02]Learning to fly, learning to run
[02:14.46]I let my heart decide the way
[02:18.74]When I was young
[02:23.11]Deep down I must have always known
[02:28.02]That this would be inevitable
[02:32.40]To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
[02:36.97]And bear my soul
[02:41.32]I know I'm not the only one
[02:46.15]Who regrets the things they've done
[02:50.62]Sometimes I just feel it's only me
[02:54.83]Who can't stand the reflection that they see
[02:59.70]I miss the air, I miss my friends
[03:04.24]I miss my mother, I miss it when
[03:08.69]Life was a party to be thrown
[03:12.94]But that was a million years ago
