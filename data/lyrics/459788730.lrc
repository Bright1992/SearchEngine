[00:21.04]I may not always love you
[00:25.16]But as long as there are stars above you
[00:31.01]You never need to doubt it
[00:35.88]I'll make you so sure about it
[00:40.61]God only knows what I'd be without you
[00:49.42]
[00:50.90]If you should ever leave me
[00:56.05]Though life would still go on, believe me
[01:00.77]The world could show nothing to me
[01:06.07]So what good would living do me
[01:11.08]God only knows what I'd be without you
[01:18.56]
[01:52.50]God only knows what I'd be without you
[02:02.58]If you should ever leave me
[02:06.76]Though life would still go on, believe me
[02:12.30]The world could show nothing to me
[02:17.25]So what good would living do me
[02:22.43]God only knows what I'd be without you
[02:30.29]Oh, oh, God only knows what I'd be without you
[02:37.65]Ooh, God only knows
[02:42.27]God only knows what I'd be without you
[02:49.14]Oh, God only knows what I'd be without you
[02:58.62]God only knows (God only knows)
[03:02.04]God only knows what I'd be without you
[03:12.00]God only knows what I'd be without you
