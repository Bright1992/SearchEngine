[00:07.63]When I was six years old
[00:09.35]I broke my leg
[00:10.76]And I was running from my brother and his friends
[00:19.13]And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
[00:27.47]I was younger then
[00:30.55]Take me back to when
[00:34.19]I found my heart and broke it here
[00:39.48]Made my friends and lost them through the years
[00:42.97]And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
[00:48.13]I know I've grown
[00:49.57]I can't wait to go home
[00:53.29]I'm on my way
[00:55.45]Driving at 90 down those
[01:00.84]Country lanes
[01:02.63]Singing to Tiny Dancer
[01:07.36]And I miss the way you made me feel
[01:12.89]It's real, we watched the sunset
[01:17.84]Over the castle on the hill
[01:23.34]
[01:25.91]Fifteen years old
[01:27.54]And smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
[01:31.95]Running from the law through the backfields
[01:35.56]And getting drunk with my friends
[01:39.43]Had my first kiss on a Friday night
[01:43.50]I don't reckon that I did it right
[01:47.14]But I was younger then
[01:49.20]Take me back to when
[01:52.64]We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
[01:57.76]We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
[02:01.30]Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
[02:06.56]Oh, how we've grown
[02:08.92]I can't wait to go home
[02:11.43]I'm on my way
[02:13.65]Driving at 90 down those
[02:19.09]Country lanes
[02:21.77]Singing to Tiny Dancer
[02:25.66]And I miss the way you made me feel
[02:31.45]It's real, we watched the sunset
[02:35.95]Over the castle on the hill
[02:40.93]Over the castle on the hill
[02:49.91]Over the castle on the hill
[02:57.54]
[03:01.26]One friend left to sell clothes
[03:05.00]One works down by the coast
[03:08.65]One had two kids but lives alone
[03:12.02]One's brother overdosed
[03:15.94]One's already on his second wife
[03:19.14]One's just barely getting by
[03:22.85]But these people raised me
[03:25.27]And I can't wait to go home
[03:29.82]And I'm on my way
[03:32.23]I still remember these old
[03:37.82]Country lanes
[03:39.98]When we did not know the answers
[03:43.86]And I miss the way you made me feel
[03:49.30]It's real, we watched the sunset
[03:54.14]Over the castle on the hill
[04:01.58]Over the castle on the hill
[04:08.17]Over the castle on the hill
[04:13.48]
