[00:10] Look at you kids with your vintage music
[00:14] Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
[00:19] You're part of the past, but now you're the future
[00:24] Signals crossing can get confusing
[00:30] It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
[00:38] Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy
[00:48] You get ready, you get all dressed up
[00:53] To go nowhere in particular
[00:58] Back to work or the coffee shop
[01:03] Doesn't matter cause it's enough
[01:08] To be young and in love (Ah, ah)
[01:17] To be young and in love (Ah, ah)
[01:27] Look at you kids, you know you're the coolest
[01:32] The world is yours and you can't refuse it
[01:37] Seen so much, you could get the blues
[01:42] But that don't mean that you should abuse it
[01:48] Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
[01:56] I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
[02:06] But you get ready, you get all dressed up
[02:11] To go nowhere in particular
[02:16] Back to work or the coffee shop
[02:21] It don't matter cause it's enough
[02:25] To be young and in love (Ah, ah)
[02:34] To be young and in love (Ah, ah)

[03:00] Don't worry, baby
[03:05] And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
[03:15] It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
[03:24] I get ready, I get all dressed up
[03:29] To go nowhere in particular
[03:34] It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
[03:38] For the future or the things to come
[03:42] 'Cause I'm young and in love (Ah, ah)
[03:52] I'm young and in love (Ah, ah)
[04:02] Hmm (Ah, ah)
