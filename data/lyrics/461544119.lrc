[00:08.20]I got this feeling inside my bones
[00:12.29]It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
[00:16.53]All through my city, all through my home
[00:20.75]We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone
[00:24.47]I got that sunshine in my pocket
[00:27.41]Got that good soul in my feet
[00:29.51]I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
[00:33.83]I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
[00:38.60]Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
[00:41.49]And under the lights when everything goes
[00:46.29]Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
[00:50.52]When we move, well, you already know
[00:54.90]So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
[00:59.78]Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
[01:03.42]A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
[01:05.81]So just dance, dance, dance, come on
[01:08.27]All those things I shouldn't do
[01:10.20]But you dance, dance, dance
[01:12.00]And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
[01:16.00]I can't stop the feeling
[01:18.56]So just dance, dance, dance
[01:20.17]I can't stop the feeling
[01:22.79]So just dance, dance, dance, come on
[01:25.49]Ooh, it's something magical
[01:28.78]It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
[01:32.98]I don't need no reason, don't need control
[01:37.20]I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
[01:40.90]Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
[01:43.92]Got that good soul in my feet
[01:45.94]I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
