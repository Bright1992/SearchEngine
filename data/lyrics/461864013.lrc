[00:20.57]I don’t know why I keep moving my body
[00:25.44]I don’t know if this is wrong or if it’s right
[00:30.19]I don’t know if there’s a beat, or something’s taking over me
[00:35.47]And I just know I’ll feel so good tonight
[00:38.75]
[00:47.40]I don’t know what your name is but I like it
[00:51.64]I’ve been thinking ‘bout some things I wanna try
[00:56.30]I don’t know what you came to do, but I wanna do it with you
[01:01.59]And I just know I’ll feel so good tonight
[01:04.44]
[01:05.76]Oh, if we keep on dancing
[01:09.88]Take our rhythm to new heights
[01:15.72]Feel the heat of passion, baby
[01:20.46]Light up the night
[01:23.26]
[01:23.93]We could start a fire
[01:26.35]Come on, let it burn baby
[01:28.70]We could start a fire
[01:31.10]Let the tables turn baby
[01:33.37]We could start a fire
[01:38.14]
[01:39.21]I just know I feel so good

[01:43.94]I just know I feel so good
[01:48.39]Tonight
[01:49.77]
[01:52.82]I don’t care if this tuns into a riot
[01:57.56]Lets get reckless, tear this place down to the floor
[02:02.22]Turn the music way up loud
[02:04.58]Can’t nobody stop us now
[02:07.50]I just know I feel so good tonight
[02:12.20]I just know I feel so good tonight
[02:14.85]
[02:34.50]We could start a fire
[02:36.86]Come on, let it burn baby
[02:39.29]We could start a fire
[02:41.60]Let the tables turn baby
[02:44.30]We could start a fire
[02:49.17]
[02:49.81]I just know I feel so good
[02:52.20]Don’t you know I feel so good
[02:54.55]Don’t you know, don’t you know?
[02:58.98]Tonight
