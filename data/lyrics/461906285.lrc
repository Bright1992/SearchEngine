[00:10.27]City of stars
[00:13.17]Are you shining just for me?
[00:20.09]City of stars
[00:23.03]There's so much that I can't see
[00:29.28]Who knows?
[00:32.69]Is this the start of something wonderful and new?
[00:38.92]Or one more dream that I cannot make true?
[00:53.13]Barefoot, she smiled
[00:56.83]And leapt, without looking
[01:00.47]And tumbled into the Seine
[01:07.32]The water was freezing
[01:11.39]She spent a month sneezing
[01:14.90]But said she would do it again
[01:22.21]Here's to the ones who dream
[01:28.95]Foolish as they may seem
[01:35.34]Here's to the hearts that ache
[01:41.66]Here's to the mess we make
[01:46.18]She told me:
[01:49.97]"A bit of madness is key
[01:53.14]To give us new colors to see
[01:57.69]Who knows where it will lead us?
[02:02.10]And that's why they need us"
[02:05.82]So bring on the rebels
[02:08.41]The ripples from pebbles
[02:10.75]The painters, and poets, and plays
[02:15.06]And here's to the fools who dream
[02:21.25]Crazy as they may seem
[02:26.21]Here's to the hearts that break
[02:31.42]Here's to the mess we make
[02:39.52]City of stars
[02:42.86]Are you shining just for me?
[02:49.45]City of stars
[02:54.58]You never shined so brightly
