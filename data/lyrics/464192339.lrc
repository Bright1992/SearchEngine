[00:00.16]She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[00:02.57]But she fell in love with an English man
[00:04.62]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[00:07.02]Said baby I just want to dance
[00:08.98]
[00:09.23]I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
[00:11.90]She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
[00:14.44]She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
[00:16.71]Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?
[00:19.12]
[00:19.27]She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
[00:21.51]She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shot gun
[00:23.66]Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
[00:26.07]Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know
[00:28.59]
[00:28.79]She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[00:30.95]But she fell in love with an English man
[00:33.19]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[00:35.47]Said baby I just want to dance
[00:37.83]
[00:37.98]My pretty little Galway girl
[00:41.34]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[00:43.50]
[00:47.87]You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
[00:50.19]And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
[00:52.69]As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
[00:54.96]After dancing to Cèili, singing to trad tunes
[00:57.32]I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
[00:59.64]Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
[01:02.11]Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
[01:04.46]And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me
[01:06.86]
[01:07.06]She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[01:09.42]But she fell in love with an English man
[01:11.47]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[01:14.05]Said baby I just want to dance
[01:16.16]
[01:16.36]My pretty little Galway girl
[01:19.21]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[01:24.17]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[01:28.95]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[01:32.96]
[01:35.71]Now we've outstayed our welcome and it’s closing time
[01:38.03]I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
[01:40.29]Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
[01:42.69]As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
[01:45.19]
[01:45.40]I walked her home then she took me inside
[01:47.50]Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
[01:49.91]I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
[01:52.21]About a Galway girl and a perfect night
[01:54.90]
[01:55.20]She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[01:57.51]But she fell in love with an English man
[01:59.71]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[02:02.08]Said baby I just want to dance
[02:04.02]
[02:04.31]My pretty little Galway girl
[02:07.28]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[02:12.14]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[02:16.87]My my my my my my my Gal
