[00:01.00]Waiting for the time to pass you by
[00:05.29]Hope the winds of change will change your mind
[00:10.02]I could give a thousand reasons why
[00:13.81]And I know you, and you've got to
[00:18.54]Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
[00:21.92]We can stay forever young
[00:24.17]Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
[00:26.36]Underneath the rising sun
[00:28.80]I could give a thousand reasons why
[00:32.69]But you're going, and you know that
[00:36.17]
[00:37.38]All you have to do is stay a minute
[00:39.88]Just take your time
[00:42.97]The clock is ticking, so stay
[00:46.51]All you have to do is wait a second
[00:50.04]Your hands on mine
[00:52.48]The clock is ticking, so stay
[00:57.70]
[01:05.61]All you have to do is
[01:15.53]All you have to do is stay
[01:16.27]Won't admit what I already know
[01:20.58]I've never been the best at letting go
[01:25.62]I don't wanna spend the night alone
[01:29.45]Guess I need you, and I need to
[01:34.38]Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up
[01:37.38]We can stay forever young
[01:39.47]Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
[01:41.80]Underneath the rising sun
[01:44.24]I could give a million reasons why
[01:47.84]But you're going, and you know that
[01:51.72]
[01:52.37]All you have to do is stay a minute
[01:55.71]Just take your time
[01:58.21]The clock is ticking, so stay
[02:01.89]All you have to do is wait a second
[02:04.32]Your hands on mine
[02:07.17]The clock is ticking, so stay
[02:11.89]
[02:21.07]All you have to do is
[02:30.59]All you have to do is stay
[02:31.44]Won't admit what I already know
[02:35.84]I've never been the best at letting go
[02:40.67]I don't wanna spend the night alone
[02:44.66]Guess I need you, and I need to
