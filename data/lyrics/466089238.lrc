[00:47.11]I try to make the worst seem better
[00:49.89]Lord, show me the way
[00:53.95]To cut through all his worn out leather

[01:14.75]I try to make the worst seem better
[01:21.46]To cut through all his worn out leather

[02:18.61]
[02:24.94]I try to make the worst seem better
[02:31.75]To cut through all his worn out leather

[02:54.73]But baby, I just need one good one
[02:57.65]Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one
[03:01.70]
[03:01.71]When I bow down to pray
[03:05.98]I try to make the worst seem better
[03:08.75]Lord, show me the way
[03:12.80]To cut through all his worn out leather
[03:16.02]I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
[03:22.28]But baby, I just need one good one to stay
[03:27.63]
[03:33.45]I try to make the worst seem better
[03:40.30]To cut through all his worn out leather
[03:47.18]I try to make the worst seem better
[03:53.95]To cut through all his worn out leather
