[00:07.09]It was great at the very start
[00:11.90]Hands on each other
[00:14.87]Couldn't stand to be far apart
[00:19.19]Closer the better
[00:21.28]
[00:21.79]Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
[00:26.05]Magnifying all our flaws
[00:29.43]And I wonder why, wonder what for
[00:33.66]Why we keep coming back for more
[00:38.25]
[00:39.23]Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
[00:46.72]Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
[00:50.49]Cause we're scared to be lonely?
[00:54.23]Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
[01:01.71]Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
[01:05.39]Cause we're scared to be lonely?
[01:08.11]
[01:35.55]Cause we're scared to be lonely?
[01:38.19]
[01:44.75]Too much time, losing track of us
[01:49.20]Where was the real?
[01:52.28]Undefined, spiraling out of touch
[01:56.58]Forgot how it feels
[01:58.86]
[01:59.30]All the messed up fights and slamming doors
[02:03.58]Magnifying all our flaws
[02:06.82]And I wonder why, wonder what for
[02:11.01]Why we keep coming back for more
[02:15.45]
[02:16.57]Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
[02:24.05]Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
[02:27.96]Cause we're scared to be lonely?
[02:31.59]Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
[02:39.12]Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
[02:42.89]Cause we're scared to be lonely?
[02:45.65]
[03:13.04]Cause we're scared to be lonely?
