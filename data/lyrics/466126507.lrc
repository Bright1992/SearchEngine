[00:00.61]It was great at the very start
[00:05.41]Hands on each other
[00:08.36]Couldn't stand to be far apart
[00:12.92]Closer the better
[00:14.94]
[00:15.40]Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
[00:19.63]Magnifying all our flaws
[00:22.95]And I wonder why, wonder what for
[00:27.18]Why we keep coming back for more
[00:31.66]
[00:32.90]Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
[00:40.46]Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
[00:44.28]Cause we're scared to be lonely?
[00:48.00]Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
[00:55.54]Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
[00:59.28]Cause we're scared to be lonely?
[01:01.96]
[01:16.26]Too much time, losing track of us
[01:20.86]Where was the real?
[01:23.89]Undefined, spiraling out of touch
[01:28.06]Forgot how it feels
[01:30.58]
[01:31.03]All the messed up fights and slamming doors
[01:35.26]Magnifying all our flaws
[01:38.57]And I wonder why, wonder what for
[01:42.50]It's like we keep coming back for more
[01:47.44]
[01:48.36]Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
[01:56.10]Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
[01:59.86]Cause we're scared to be lonely?
[02:03.57]Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
[02:11.13]Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
[02:14.90]Cause we're scared to be lonely?
[02:17.57]
[02:22.86]Scared to be lonely
[02:25.43]
[02:26.28]Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
[02:30.07]Cause we're scared to be lonely?
