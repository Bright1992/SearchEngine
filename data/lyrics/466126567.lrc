[03:41.72]Break down the walls to connect, inspire
[03:43.67]Ay, up in your high place, liars
[03:45.76]Time is ticking for the empire
[03:48.05]The truth they feed is feeble
[03:49.54]As so many times before
[03:51.45]They greed over the people
[03:53.73]They stumbling and fumbling
[03:55.18]And we're about to riot
[03:56.32]They woke up, they woke up the lions
[03:57.96](Woo!)
