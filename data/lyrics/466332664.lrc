[00:09.92]Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
[00:14.24]I drink too much
[00:15.70]And that's an issue, but I'm okay
[00:20.07]Hey, you tell your friends
[00:22.95]It was nice to meet them
[00:24.49]But I hope I never see them again
[00:30.37]I know it breaks your heart, that I only smoke papers, I don't smoke 'gars babe
[00:35.86]I'm at an old school bar taking drink to the face, so we both go far
[00:40.19]And I-I-I can't stop
[00:44.30]Let's get high we can't stop
[00:49.19]No
[00:49.84]So, baby, pull me closer
[00:51.95]In the backseat of your Rover
[00:54.66]That I know you can't afford
[00:57.03]Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
[00:59.45]Pull the sheets right off the corner
[01:02.01]Of the mattress that you stole
[01:04.58]From your roommate back in Boulder
[01:06.99]We ain't ever getting older
[01:17.50]We ain't ever getting older
[01:25.10]Khalifa man
[01:26.70]We ain't ever getting older
[01:30.17]Khalifa man, I'm fresh off of the plane
[01:32.68]Been smoking so long I got my own string
[01:35.30]Roll up a joint and take it to the brain
[01:37.81]Say you can't hide, but now you speaking my own language
[01:40.42]Left with me as soon as we came
[01:42.79]Spoke some bullshit, she'll never do it again
[01:45.36]Try anything, she'll never do it again
[01:47.61]Fuck Khalifa man, 'cos you'll never do it again
[01:50.53]I know it breaks your heart, that I only smoke papers, I don't smoke 'gars babe
[01:56.17]I'm at an old school bar taking drink to the face, so we both go far
[02:00.64]And I-I-I can't stop
[02:04.47]Let's get high we can't stop
[02:08.89]No
[02:10.10]So, baby, pull me closer
[02:12.56]In the backseat of your Rover
[02:14.97]That I know you can't afford
[02:17.44]Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
[02:19.87]Pull the sheets right off the corner
[02:22.43]Of the mattress that you stole
[02:25.14]From your roommate back in Boulder
[02:27.41]We ain't ever getting older
[02:37.38]We ain't ever getting older
[02:47.59]We ain't ever getting older
[02:50.75]So, baby, pull me closer
[02:52.81]In the backseat of your Rover
[02:55.28]That I know you can't afford
[02:57.59]Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
[03:00.05]Pull the sheets right off the corner
[03:02.62]Of the mattress that you stole
[03:05.08]From your roommate back in Boulder
[03:07.91]We ain't ever getting older
[03:10.36]We ain't ever getting older
[03:12.73](No, we ain't ever getting older)
[03:15.74]We ain't ever getting older
[03:17.62](No, we ain't ever getting older)
[03:20.74]We ain't ever getting older
