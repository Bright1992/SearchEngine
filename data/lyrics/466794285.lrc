[00:04.20]Somebody's gonna wave a flag
[00:06.56]Somebody's going to attack
[00:08.72]Somebody will tell you to pick a side
[00:11.15]Tell you their version of wrong or right
[00:13.96]Somebody's gonna let you in
[00:16.37]Judged on the color of your skin
[00:18.44]Slam a door in the face of your friend
[00:20.93]Simply because you don't look like him
[00:23.51]And then you gotta find a way that you're wakin'
[00:25.76]Everybody's walkin'
[00:28.41]You gotta find the words to say when you're talkin'
[00:30.65]Everybody's talkin'
[00:31.80]
[00:33.64]So I built the wars into a song
[00:40.71]I'm hopin' someone's singing along
[00:45.71]And even if some notes are wrong
[00:50.44]I'm hopin' someone's singing along
[00:53.96]
[00:54.69]'cause just one voice is not enough
[00:59.60]I need to hear from everyone
[01:04.48]And even when I'm dead and gone
[01:09.94]I'm hopin' someone's singing along

[01:14.78]Somebody's gonna build a wall
[01:17.24]Then smash it with a cannon ball
[01:19.33]Someone who somehow has got a gun
[01:21.77]Will tell you who you can't and you can love
[01:24.55]Some people keeping all the cash
[01:26.99]They're gonna get away with that
[01:29.10]Just 'cause some people don't think like me
[01:31.56]Does that really make them the enemy?
[01:33.66]
[01:34.15]And then you gotta find a way that you're wakin'
[01:36.40]Everybody's walkin'
