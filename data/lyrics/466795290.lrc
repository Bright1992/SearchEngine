[00:05.77]Let it slide
[00:09.04]All the choices I made
[00:11.98]Let it burn
[00:15.19]As it rows down my face
[00:18.03]Let it fall
[00:21.26]Just to be the one again
[00:24.05]But if I want
[00:27.17]I won't be loved by you at all
[00:30.38]Let it slip
[00:33.67]Every promise I break
[00:36.52]Let it burn
[00:39.51]All that blows that we trade
[00:42.65]Let it fall
[00:45.68]'Cause this place has been condemned
[00:48.77]And we both know
[00:51.74]That we can't be here anymore
[01:02.53]Yeah, I know I pulled a pin on your heart
[01:04.64]But I lost that all, then tell you when you let down your guard
[01:07.63]Should've run, run a hundred miles, never look back track
[01:11.13]'Cause now we can backtrack
[01:13.20]And yeah, I know, I'm just sayin' nothing can change, no one to blame
[01:16.94]It's on the tip of my tongue, here it comes, this is crazy
[01:20.29]You should know that I would go back in a heartbeat
[01:24.99]Just to make your heart beat
[01:32.01]Let it fail
[01:35.16]It's too late to be saved
[01:38.04]Let it roll
[01:41.70]They're all across this grey
[01:44.16]Let it blaze
[01:47.36]There's a darkness in the flame
[01:50.37]And it's lost
[01:53.36]And we can't bear it anymore
[01:56.46]Let it slide
[01:59.72]I can't start it again
[02:02.60]Let it burn
[02:05.72]While it's held in my hand
[02:08.74]Let it fall
[02:12.12]'Cause this journey is at its end
[02:14.94]It's only luck
[02:17.96]That I was loved by you at all
[02:28.62]Yeah, I know I pulled a pin on your heart
[02:30.81]But I lost that all, then tell you when you let down your guard
[02:33.70]Should've run, run a hundred miles, never look back track
[02:37.28]'Cause now we can backtrack
[02:39.51]And yeah, I know, I'm just sayin' nothing can change, no one to blame
[02:43.14]It's on the tip of my tongue, here it comes, this is crazy
[02:46.16]You should know that I would go back in a heartbeat
[02:51.10]Just to make your heart beat
[02:53.75]Yeah, I know I pulled a pin on your heart
[02:55.28]But I lost that all, then tell you when you let down your guard
[02:58.38]Should've run, run a hundred miles, never look back track
[03:01.50]'Cause now we can backtrack
[03:04.05]And yeah, I know, I'm just sayin' nothing can change, no one to blame
[03:07.69]It's on the tip of my tongue, here it comes, this is crazy
[03:10.95]You should know that I would go back in a heartbeat
[03:15.78]Just to make your heart beat
