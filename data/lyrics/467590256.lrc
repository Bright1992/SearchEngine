[00:28.94]The club isn't the best place to find a lover
[00:31.38]So the bar is where I go
[00:33.67]Me and my friends at the table doing shots
[00:36.02]Drinking fast and then we talk slow
[00:38.31]And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
[00:40.79]And trust me I'll give it a chance now
[00:45.31]Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
[00:46.71]And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
[00:48.10]Say, boy, let's not talk too much
[00:50.43]Grab on my waist and put that body on me
[00:53.08]Come on now, follow my lead
[00:54.92]Come, come on now, follow my lead
[01:18.13]I'm in love with the shape of you
[01:20.22]We push and pull like a magnet do
[01:23.18]Although my heart is falling too
[01:25.98]I'm in love with your body
[01:27.58]And last night you were in my room
[01:29.83]And now my bedsheets smell like you
[01:31.77]Every day discovering something brand new
[01:34.71]I'm in love with your body
[01:40.69]I'm in love with your body
[01:41.89]Every day discovering something brand new
[01:45.23]I'm in love with the shape of you
[02:05.49]One week in we let the story begin
[02:08.08]We're going out on our first date
[02:09.62]You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
[02:11.72]Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
[02:14.36]We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
[02:16.75]And how your family is doing okay
[02:19.24]Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
[02:21.93]Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
[02:24.17]Say, boy, let's not talk too much
[02:26.66]Grab on my waist and put that body on me
[02:29.41]Come on now, follow my lead
[02:32.54]Come, come on now, follow my lead
[02:54.03]I'm in love with the shape of you
[02:56.53]We push and pull like a magnet do
[02:58.52]Although my heart is falling too
[03:01.91]I'm in love with your body
[03:03.57]And last night you were in my room
[03:06.22]And now my bedsheets smell like you
[03:08.41]Every day discovering something brand new
[03:11.09]I'm in love with your body
