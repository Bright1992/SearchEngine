[00:31.34]Are we crazy?
[00:34.96]Living our lives through a lens
[00:38.90]Trapped in our white picket fence
[00:41.63]Like ornaments
[00:43.61]So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
[00:45.81]So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
[00:47.44]Aren't you lonely
[00:50.86]Up there in utopia
[00:54.43]Where nothing will ever be enough?
[00:57.62]Happily numb
[00:59.68]So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
[01:01.81]So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
[01:03.78]
[01:05.16]So put your rose-colored glasses on
[01:09.66]And party on
[01:10.75]
[01:12.17]Turn it up, it's your favorite song
[01:13.96]Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
[01:16.18]Turn it up, keep it on repeat
[01:16.11]We're all chained to the rhythm
[01:20.19]Turn it up, it's your favorite song
[01:21.93]Dance, dance, dance to the distortion

[01:28.09]
[01:33.60]We're all chained to the rhythm
[01:39.63]We're all chained to the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm
[01:49.60]We're all chained to the rhythm
[01:55.65]We're all chained to the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm
[02:00.11]
[02:07.91]Turn it up, it's your favorite song
[02:09.91]Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
[02:12.21]Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
[02:13.78]Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
[02:16.38]Yeah, we think we're free
[02:18.41]Drink, this one is on me
[02:19.62]We're all chained to the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm
[02:24.24]Turn it up, it's your favorite song
[02:25.87]Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
[02:28.20]Turn it up, it's your favorite song
