[00:02.98]I don't have a reason to cry
[00:06.38]And I have every reason to smile
[00:10.41]I don't have a reason to lie
[00:13.93]When you’re already reading my mind
[00:17.66]And I don’t have a reason to be, if I can’t be with you
[00:31.04]And I don't need air in my lungs, if I can’t sing your song
[00:38.46]No, I don’t need hands if I don’t get to keep you warm
[00:45.12]And I don’t really need myself, if I don't need you
[00:56.59]'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
[01:01.88]I open my eyes so I could see with you
[01:09.41]And I live so I can die with you
[01:26.15]And I don’t really need these fingers, if I don’t get to touch your spine
[01:33.47]Well, I don’t need these legs, if I ain’t walking by your side
[01:40.39]And I don’t really need to be if I can’t be with you
[01:51.09]'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
[01:57.90]I open my eyes so I could see with you
[02:06.81]And I live so I can die with you
[02:22.25]'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
[02:27.27]I open my eyes so I can see with you
[02:39.80]And I live so I can
[02:52.97]I live so I can， live so I can die with you
[03:18.31]
