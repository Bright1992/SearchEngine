[00:33.36]I had a dream
[00:34.98]We were sipping whiskey neat
[00:37.20]Highest floor, The Bowery
[00:39.80]Nowhere's high enough
[00:41.39]Somewhere along the lines
[00:43.23]We stopped seeing eye to eye
[00:45.36]You were staying out all night
[00:47.41]And I had enough
[00:48.90]
[00:49.48]No, I don't wanna know
[00:51.64]Where you been or where you're goin'
[00:53.70]But I know I won't be home
[00:55.65]And you'll be on your own
[00:57.28]
[00:57.55]Who's gonna walk you
[00:58.82]Through the dark side of the morning?
[01:01.82]Who's gonna rock you
[01:03.00]When the sun won't let you sleep?
[01:06.21]It ain't me
[01:07.29]
[01:14.61]It ain't me
[01:15.61](The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
[01:22.83]It ain't me
[01:23.77](The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
[01:31.25]It ain't me
[01:32.32](The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
[01:39.56]It ain't me
[01:42.08]
[01:42.12]I had a dream
[01:43.82]We were back to seventeen
[01:45.83]Summer nights and The Libertines
[01:47.93]Never growing up
[01:50.58]I'll take with me
[01:52.10]The polaroids and the memories
[01:54.17]But you know I'm gonna leave
[01:56.00]Behind the worst of us
[01:57.79]
[01:58.80]Who's gonna walk you
[01:59.29]Through the dark side of the morning?
[02:02.29]Who's gonna rock you
[02:03.51]When the sun won't let you sleep?
[02:06.44]Who's waking up to drive you home
[02:08.76]When you're drunk and all alone?
[02:10.63]Who's gonna walk you
[02:11.87]Through the dark side of the morning?
[02:14.53]
[02:15.30]It ain't me
[02:15.91](The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
[02:23.38]It ain't me
[02:24.24](The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
[02:31.74]It ain't me
[02:32.58](The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
[02:40.11]It ain't me
[02:40.91](The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful)
[02:48.47]It ain't me
[03:05.15]It ain't me
