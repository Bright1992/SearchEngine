[00:08.56]Oh, I'm in the jungle now
[00:10.69]You've been seeking, I've been hiding out
[00:12.94]Use your love, it scares me so deep down
[00:15.39]You may find me, 'cause my heart beats loud, so loud
[00:18.58]It beats fast, in the places where you touched me last
[00:22.36]I can feel the burn my skin, it has
[00:24.77]But the return of your beloved hands, hands
[00:28.12]I've lost control
[00:29.74]I paddle, but you're too strong
[00:31.97]But I gotta trust your flow
[00:34.34]'Cause boy, I'm in your waterfall
[00:36.26](Waterfall)
[00:36.84]Oh, I've lost control
[00:39.09]And babe, it's a relief to know

[01:05.21]Baby, you're my oxygen
[01:07.24]When I cannot find my way on Earth
[01:09.53]You know I can be when I hold on
[01:12.18]Even when the rapid's strong
[01:14.92]I've lost control
[01:16.88]I paddle, but you're too strong
[01:19.22]But I gotta trust your flow
[01:21.62]'Cause babe, I'm in your waterfall
[01:23.51](Waterfall)
[01:24.05]But I've lost control
