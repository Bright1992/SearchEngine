[00:10.59]People say the meanest things
[00:14.94]I've been called a dick, I've been called so many things
[00:20.98]I know I've done some shit that I admit deserves it
[00:24.19]But that...that don't mean it doesn't sting
[00:30.89]Saw you standing outside a bar
[00:34.33]Would have said you're beautiful but I've used that line before
[00:42.73]
[00:43.28]Now I've had my share of shallow nights
[00:45.04]'Cause I was scared to get it right
[00:48.24]So I was hanging with whoever
[00:51.91]But baby then you...
[00:53.83]
[00:54.02]You love, love, love me, love me better
[00:55.44]You love, love, love me, love me better
[01:03.23]There's been times I gave myself
[01:05.87]To someone else, to someone lesser than you
[01:09.49]Love, love, love me, love me better
[01:13.87]
[01:23.33]Love me better
[01:30.40]Love, love, love me, love me better
[01:35.51]
[01:37.22]When I met you I was treading water
[01:42.00]And baby I know you know I got an eye that wanders
[01:46.69]But right now in this car that we're driving to your sister's
[01:51.41]All I'm lookin' for is something that's forever
[01:56.25]Baby then you...
[01:57.47]
[01:57.92]You love, love, love me, love me better
[02:02.49]You love, love, love me, love me better
[02:07.55]There've been people that I've loved before
[02:10.38]But they were something lesser, 'cause you...
[02:13.19]Love, love, love me, love me better
[02:17.60]
[02:28.32]Love me better
[02:35.41]Love, love, love me, love me better
[02:40.01]
[02:50.58]There've been people that I've loved before
[02:53.36]But they were something lesser, 'cause you...
[02:56.58]Love, love, love me, love me better
[03:01.52]
