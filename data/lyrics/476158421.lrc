Baby I like your style
Lips on your neck
We're never too close now
Never like you and me
I don't know your name
But I'm sure that you know me
A little life with the music
The feeling is mutual
Loving the way you move on me
Skin so soft hands on my face to be directed
And you're all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
And when this song comes on you know
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin' put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin' put a hold on me
You know I like to go wild
So make your way over here right now
We only got a little while
Just thinkin' out loud
Celebrate life with me babe
Don't be in a rush to go now
Oh girl
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin' put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin' put a hold on me
Hold on me
Yeah yeah yeah
One more dance is all I need
One more dance is all I need
Oh oh oh
Baby I like your style
Grips on your waist
Front way back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti oti there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Got a hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Baby I like your style
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it wine it very long time
Oh yeah very long time
Back up back up back up and wine it
Back up back up and wine it girl
Back up back up back up and wine it
Oh yeah very long time
Back up back up and wine it girl
Tell me
I need to know where do you wanna go
Cause if you're down I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where where where
Where where where where
Where where where
Where where where where
Cause if you're down
Back up back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up back up and
I need a one dance
Got a hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
