[00:01.35]I wanna follow her where she goes
[00:04.80]I think about her and she knows it
[00:08.77]I wanna let it take control
[00:12.74]'Cause everytime that she gets closer
[00:16.71]She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
[00:22.43]And maybe I should stop and start confessing
[00:30.17]Confessing
[00:32.07]Oh, I've been shaking
[00:34.63]I love you when you go crazy
[00:36.59]You take all my inhibitions
[00:38.55]Baby, there's nothing holding me back
[00:41.03]You take me places that tear up my reputation
[00:44.43]Manipulate my decisions
[00:46.28]Baby, there's nothing holding me back
[00:49.00]There's nothing holding me back
[00:56.97]There's nothing holding me back
[01:04.75]She says that she is never afraid
[01:07.99]Just picture everybody naked
[01:12.30]She really doesn't like to wait
[01:15.85]Not really into hesitation
[01:19.80]Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
[01:25.18]And maybe I should stop and start confessing
[01:33.02]Confessing
[01:35.13]Oh, I've been shaking

[01:52.06]There's nothing holding me back
[02:00.05]There's nothing holding me back
[02:08.75]'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
[02:10.84]I know we'd be alright, I know we'd be alright
[02:14.94]'Cause if you are by my side and we stumbled in the dark
[02:18.60]I know we'd be alright, I know we'd be alright
[02:22.75]'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
[02:26.36]I know we'd be alright, I know we'd be alright
