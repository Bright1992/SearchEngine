[00:00.400]I was at Coachella
[00:02.470]Leaning on your shoulder
[00:04.800]Watching your husband swing in time
[00:08.330]I guess I was in it
[00:09.920]Cause baby for a minute
[00:11.660]It was Woodstock in my mind
[00:15.470]In the next morning
[00:17.320]They put out the warning
[00:19.180]Tensions were rising over country lines
[00:22.850]I turned off the music
[00:24.710]Tried to sit and use it
[00:26.500]All of the love that I saw that night
[00:30.020]'Cause what about all these children
[00:33.140]And what about all their parents
[00:37.390]And what about about all their crowns they wear
[00:41.050]In hair so long like mine
[00:45.030]And what about all their wishes
[00:48.180]Wrapped up like garland roses
[00:51.950]Round their little heads
[00:55.130]I said a prayer for a third time
[00:59.310]I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway)
[01:06.570]I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (stairway)
[01:12.820]I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (stairway)
[01:20.740]I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
[01:28.130]I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
[01:36.740]I was at Coachella
[01:38.550]Leaning on your shoulder
[01:40.440]Watching your husband swing and shine
[01:44.090]I'd say he was hella, cool to win them over
[01:47.840]Critics can be so mean sometimes
[01:51.520]He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down with his words and his words divine
[01:58.720]Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
[02:02.460]To not want music 'cause they lost their minds
[02:06.360]'Cause what about all these children
[02:09.640]And all their children's children
[02:13.220]And why am I even wondering that today
[02:20.820]Maybe my contribution
[02:23.960]Could be as small as hoping
[02:27.960]That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way
[02:35.180]I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway)
[02:42.400]I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (a stairway)
[02:49.570]I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (a stairway)
[02:56.910]I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
[03:04.080]I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
[03:11.010]
[03:12.820]A stairway, stairway to heaven
[03:24.050]A stairway
[03:27.020]Got a million things I wanna say
[03:30.700]Like what is it all for?, Will it be okay?
[03:34.740]Million things I wanna say
[03:38.160]Like what is it all for?
[03:42.520]Stairway, stairway to heaven
[03:53.530]Stairway
[03:57.380]Stairway, stairway to heaven
[04:08.390]Stairway
[04:11.880]
