[00:00.380]Baby, I can't be what you want me to be
[00:07.694]I've given you everything, I've sailed the sea
[00:15.166]Baby, there's fireworks in my heart setting off
[00:21.989]Darling, I wish you hadn't let us fall apart
[00:29.388]I promise I tried to let this go but I can't breathe
[00:36.700]If only you knew how much I give you, everything you need
[00:44.107]So the space and time around us go to waste
[00:51.428]Baby, I think I'm losing you, can see it in your face
[00:58.817]Don't leave
[01:03.598]
[01:05.791]Don't leave
[01:10.468]
[01:13.365]I need you
[01:17.261]
[01:21.005]And I need you, oh
[01:25.756]
[01:42.260]And I need you
[02:01.092]Cause darling, you mean the world to me
[02:04.652]And I need you
[02:08.174]Cause darling, you've got the best of me
[02:12.804]
[02:26.157]Don't leave
[02:31.044]
[02:33.103]Don't leave
