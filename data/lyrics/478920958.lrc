[00:08.10]I was walking down the street the other day
[00:10.90]Trying to distract myself
[00:12.87]But then I see your face
[00:14.65]Ooh, you got someone else
[00:16.92]Trying to play it coy
[00:18.47]Trying to make it disappear
[00:20.47]But just like the battle of Troy
[00:22.59]There’s nothing subtle here
[00:24.69]In my room there’s a king size space
[00:26.57]Bigger than it used to be
[00:28.40]If you want you can rent that place
[00:30.47]Call me an amenity
[00:34.74]Even if it’s in my dreams
[00:40.41]Ooh you’re taking all perfection out my mind
[00:47.68]Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine
[00:55.84]I’m trying
[01:03.55]Not to think about you
[01:06.35]No no no
[01:07.46]Not to think about you
[01:10.07]No no no
[01:11.65]I’m trying
[01:19.27]Not to give it to you
[01:22.39]No no no
[01:23.44]Not to give it to you
[01:27.30]All my feelings on fire
[01:29.58]Guess I’m a bad liar
[01:32.07]I see how your attention builds
[01:33.90]It’s like looking in a mirror
[01:35.93]Your touch like a happy pill
[01:37.91]But still all we do is fear
[01:40.20]What could possibly happen next
[01:42.34]Can we focus on the love
[01:44.04]Paint my kiss across your chest
[01:45.85]Feel the art, I'll be the brush
[01:47.62]Ooh you’re taking all perfection out my mind
[01:55.12]Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine
[02:03.12]I’m trying
[02:10.59]Not to think about you
[02:13.80]No no no
[02:15.26]Not to think about you
[02:17.86]No no no
[02:19.07]I’m trying
[02:26.50]Not to give it to you
[02:29.78]No no no
[02:30.95]Not to give it to you
[02:34.69]All my feelings on fire
[02:36.98]Guess I’m a bad liar
[02:39.47]And oh baby let’s make reality actuality a reality
[02:47.84]oh baby let’s make reality actuality a reality
[02:56.77]I’m trying
[03:03.75]Not to think about you
[03:07.37]No no no
[03:08.41]Not to think about you
[03:11.43]No no no
[03:12.61]I’m trying
[03:20.08]Not to give it to you
[03:23.23]No no no
[03:24.32]Not to give it to you
[03:28.50]All my feelings on fire
[03:30.58]Guess I’m a bad liar
