[00:15] As days go by and fade to nights
[00:20] I still question why you left
[00:28] But now you're gone
[00:34] But no, it's not over
[00:37] We'll get older, we'll get over
[00:46] I still believe that we'll get it right again
[00:53] We'll come back to life again
[00:56] We won't say another goodbye again
[01:06]Someday
[01:13]We'll be together
[01:15]Someday
[01:19]someday
[01:20]We'll be together
[01:26]I heard someday might be today
[01:30]Mysteries of destinies
[01:39]For all we know they come tomorrow
[01:54]To feel again to walk on the face
[01:59]I believe there is more to life
[02:03]Oh, I love you much more than life itself
[02:07]I believe I can change your mind
[02:11]Revive what is dying inside
[02:17]And someday, someday
[02:25]Someday
[02:29]someday
[02:31]We'll be together
[02:33]Someday
[02:37]someday
[02:43]We'll be together
[02:48]We'll be together
[00:23.5] I wonder how it didn't work out
[00:29.7] And memories all I have for now
[00:40.5] We'll live to see the day that I hope for
[00:44.7] Come back to me
[00:59.3]You'll live forever with me
[01:10.8]someday
[01:34.5]They are somehow and are someway
[01:42.7]For today my eyes are open
[01:46.7]My arms are raised for your embrace
[01:50.5]My hands are here to mend what is broken
[02:23.5]We'll be together
[02:39.7]We'll be together
[02:53.8]Someday
