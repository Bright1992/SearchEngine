[00:12.790]Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
[00:16.930]I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
[00:20.300]I fell right through the cracks
[00:22.820]and now I'm trying to get back
[00:25.830]Before the cool done run out
[00:27.860]I'll be giving it my bestest
[00:29.660]Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
[00:32.770]I reckon its again my turn to win some or learn some
[00:39.170]But I won't hesitate no more, no more
[00:46.290]It cannot wait I'm yours
[01:04.849]Well open up your mind and see like me
[01:08.430]Open up your plans and damn you're free
[01:11.510]Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
[01:17.130]Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
[01:21.620]We're just one big family
[01:24.420]It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love love
[01:32.720]So I won't hesitate no more no more

[02:02.900]But do you want to come on
[02:03.770]Scooch on over closer dear
[02:06.540]And i will nibble your ear
[02:22.840]I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
[02:27.190]And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
[02:30.370]but My breath fogged up the glass
[02:32.760]And so I drew a new face and laughed
[02:36.710]I guess what i'ma saying is there ain't no better reason
[02:39.880]To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
[02:43.500]It's what we aim to do
[02:45.890]Our name is our virtue
[02:49.590]But I won't hesitate no more no more
[02:56.690]It cannot wait I'm yours
[03:02.970]Open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
[03:06.130]Open up your plans and damn you're free (No more, no more)
[03:09.280]Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours (It cannot wait, I'm sure)
[03:14.820]So please don't, please don't please don't (There's no need to complicate)
[03:17.500]There's no need to complicate (Our time is short)
[03:20.420]Coz our time is short (This is our fate)
[03:22.890]This is this is this is our fate
[03:25.420]I'm yours
