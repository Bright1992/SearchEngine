[03:02.240]We\'ll be the talk of the town
[03:06.400]I\'ll tell the world I\'m in love any time
[03:10.980]Let\'s open up the blinds \'cause we really don\'t mind
[03:48.760]Ooh I don\'t care about the propriety
[03:54.760]Let\'s break the rules and ignore society
[03:58.470]Maybe our neighbors like to spy, it\'s true
[04:02.460]So what if they watch when we do what we do
[04:06.880]Oh, let\'s go to the park
