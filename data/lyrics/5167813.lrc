[00:13.82]Imagine there's no heaven
[00:20.34]It's easy if you try
[00:27.06]No hell below us
[00:34.19]Above us only sky
[00:39.91]Imagine all the people
[00:45.72]Living for today
[00:53.33]Imagine there's no countries
[00:59.32]It isn't hard to do
[01:05.95]Nothing to kill or die for
[01:12.43]No religion too
[01:18.69]Imagine all the people
[01:24.70]Living life in peace
[01:29.50]You, you may say I'm a dreamer
[01:38.62]But I'm not the only one
[01:44.69]I hope someday you'll join us
[01:51.77]And the world will be as one
[01:57.57]Imagine no possessions
[02:04.03]I wonder if you can
[02:10.44]No need for greed or hunger
[02:16.94]A brotherhood of man
[02:23.54]Imagine all the people
[02:29.61]Sharing all the world
[02:34.13]And you, you may say I'm a dreamer
[02:43.42]But I'm not the only one
[02:49.53]I hope someday you'll join us
[02:56.76]And the world will be as one
