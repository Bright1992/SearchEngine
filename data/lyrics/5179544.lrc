[00:35.200]My life is brilliant.
[00:37.960]My love is pure.
[00:41.070]I saw an angel.
[00:43.810]Of that I'm sure.
[00:46.470]She smiled at me on the subway.
[00:48.780]She was with another man.
[00:51.610]But I won't lose no sleep on that,
[00:55.340]'Cause I've got a plan.
[00:58.810]You're beautiful.
[01:01.980]You're beautiful.
[01:04.840]You're beautiful, it's true.
[01:09.200]I saw your face in a crowded place,
[01:15.880]And I don't know what to do,
[01:21.830]'Cause I'll never be with you.
[01:27.260]
[01:36.670]Yeah, she caught my eye,
[01:40.160]As we walked on by.
[01:43.510]She could see from my face that I was,
[01:46.460]Fucking high,
[01:49.070]And I don't think that I'll see her again,
[01:54.550]But we shared a moment that will last till the end.
[02:00.840]You're beautiful.
[02:05.110]You're beautiful.
[02:08.080]You're beautiful, it's true.
[02:11.890]I saw your face in a crowded place,
[02:18.730]And I don't know what to do,
[02:25.900]'Cause I'll never be with you.
[02:30.140]
[02:43.530]You're beautiful.
[02:47.260]You're beautiful.
[02:49.830]You're beautiful, it's true.
[02:55.760]There must be an angel with a smile on her face,
[03:01.730]When she thought up that I should be with you.
[03:13.880]But it's time to face the truth,
[03:19.260]I will never be with you.
