[00:30.59]Oceans apart day after day
[00:37.78]And I slowly go insane
[00:42.48]I hear your voice on the line
[00:48.49]But it doesn't stop the pain
[00:53.21]I see you next to never
[00:58.61]How can we say forever
[01:03.55]Wherever you go
[01:06.29]Whatever you do
[01:08.95]I will be right here waiting for you
[01:14.19]Whatever it takes
[01:17.11]Or how my heart breaks
[01:19.37]I will be right here waiting for you
[01:30.78]I took for granted all the times
[01:36.69]That I thought would last somehow
[01:41.50]I hear the laughter I taste the tears
[01:47.48]But I can't get near you now
[01:51.90]Oh can't you see it baby
[01:57.58]You've got me going crazy
[02:02.66]Wherever you go
[02:05.25]Whatever you do
[02:07.75]I will be right here waiting for you
[02:13.28]Whatever it takes
[02:16.11]Or how my heart breaks
[02:18.44]I will be right here waiting for you
[02:24.72]I wonder how we can survive
[02:30.21]this romance
[02:34.77]But in the end if I'm with you
[02:39.80]I'll take the chance
[03:07.83]Oh can't you see it baby
[03:12.28]You've got me going crazy
[03:17.39]Wherever you go
[03:20.84]Whatever you do
[03:23.56]I will be right here waiting for you
[03:28.57]Whatever it takes
[03:31.33]Or how my heart breaks
[03:33.62]I will be right here waiting for you
[03:47.90]waiting for you~
