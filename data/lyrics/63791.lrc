[00:13.900]Ma Ma do you remember,
[00:21.150]the old straw hat you gave to me,
[00:28.500]I lost that hat long ago,
[00:36.060]flew to the foggy canyon.
[00:43.070]Yeh Ma ma I wonder
[00:51.370]what happened to that old straw hat,
[00:58.850]falling down the mountain side
[01:06.340]out of my reach like your heart.
[01:12.820][01:14.420]Suddenly that wind came up,
[01:21.880]stealing my hat from me yeh.
[01:29.190]Swirling whirling gust of wind,
[01:36.650]blowing it higher away.
[01:44.480][01:48.080]Ma ma that old straw hat
[01:55.060]was the only one I really loved,
[02:02.630]but we lost it.
[02:06.150]No one could bring it back,
[02:09.960]like the life you gave me.
[02:16.440][02:47.690]Suddenly that wind came up,
[02:54.950]stealing my hat from me yeh.
[03:02.230]Swirling whirling gust of wind,
[03:09.660]blowing it higher away.
[03:17.840][03:20.960]Ma ma that old straw hat
[03:27.930]was the only one I really loved,
[03:35.530]but we lost it.
[03:39.260]No one could bring it back,
[03:43.050]like the life you gave me.
[03:50.630]like the life you gave me.
