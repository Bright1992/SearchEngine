[00:24.480]I saw a picture of you
[00:27.930]Hanging in an empty hallway
[00:30.420]I heard a voice that I knew
[00:34.010]And I couldn't walk away
[00:36.220]It took me back to the end
[00:40.560]Of everything
[00:42.110]I taste it all I taste it all
[00:44.840]The tears again
[00:47.620]
[00:48.280]Outside the rain's fallin' down
[00:52.390]There's not a drop that hits me
[00:54.370]Scream at the sky but no sound
[00:58.240]Is leavin' my lips
[01:00.510]It's like I can't even feel
[01:04.220]After the way you touched me
[01:06.390]I'm not asleep but I'm not awake
[01:09.840]After the way you loved me
[01:12.140]
[01:12.530]I can't turn this around
[01:17.740]I keep running into walls that I can't break down
[01:23.520]I said I just wander around
[01:29.500]With my eyes wide shut because of you
[01:34.960]I'm a sleepwalker walker walker
[01:40.460]I'm a sleepwalker walker walker
[01:46.450]
[01:47.120]Let me out of this dream
[01:49.110]
[01:49.310]Everywhere that I go
[01:52.310]I see another memory
[01:54.430]And all the places we used to know
[01:58.320]They're always there to haunt me
[02:00.380]I walk around and I feel so lost and lonely
[02:06.580]You're everything that I want
[02:10.180]But you don't want me
[02:11.880]
[02:12.330]I can't turn this around
[02:17.610]I keep running into walls that I can't break down
[02:23.540]I said I just wander around
[02:29.530]With my eyes wide shut because of you
[02:34.930]I'm a sleepwalker walker walker
[02:40.440]I'm a sleepwalker walker walker
[02:46.280]
[02:47.190]Let me out of this dream, dream
[02:52.780]Let me out of this dream
[02:58.600]
[03:29.820]I can't turn this around
[03:35.050]I keep running into walls that I can't break down
[03:41.310]I said I just wander around
[03:47.260]With my eyes wide shut because of you
[03:53.090]I'm a sleepwalker walker walker
[03:58.630]I'm a sleepwalker walker walker
[04:04.610]I'm a sleepwalker walker walker
[04:10.560]I'm a sleepwalker walker walker
[04:16.160]
[04:17.340]Let me out of this dream
[04:19.790]
